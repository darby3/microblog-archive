				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;m planning on running a full marathon in 2024.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been planning for this since I started training for the half marathon I just ran. I looked at the half marathon as a chance to dip my toe in the distance-running water to see whether I liked the feel for this kind of training or whether it felt like too much. So far, so good: nothing about the half marathon cycle I just went through made me want to give up.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s funny, because even with what I&rsquo;ve done, I still feel like I have a little imposter syndrome, when it comes to running. I still feel very conservative in my approach, using the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; still kind of makes me want to break out in hives, and I come into this knowing that running a full marathon isn&rsquo;t some huge life-long dream of mine. (For that, you&rsquo;d have to look at biking. While I&rsquo;ve biked one metric century, I still feel like I&rsquo;ve got at least one full 100 mile ride in me. Some day.) I started running three years ago in order to support a particular charity 5k, and with two kids in the house I was looking for a form of exercise that was a bit more effective than bicycling (which long rides, when I was training for that metric century, took me out of the house <em>forrrevvvver</em>), and because I generally thought it would be cool to be able to run a full mile without stopping. After a couple rocky years I got more consistent with running last year and started wondering if I could run a marathon.</p>\n<p>And I started to think that maybe I could. And I started to think that maybe if I thought I could, if I even had an inkling of interest in it, maybe I should do something about it sooner rather than later, because while I&rsquo;m not old, I&rsquo;m certainly not getting any younger. At one point I thought about just going straight for it in 2023 but then decided I&rsquo;m just not that hardcore. So I came up with a loose plan to give myself well over a year to build up to it while also giving myself plenty of freedom to back out at any time for any reason with no penalty.</p>\n<p>And now here I am, my first half marathon in the books, and as of right now, that big-picture goal still seems reasonable. I mean, it seems crazy, but also possible. Nothing about this process the last few months made me want to quit. Whether or not I actually make it all the way I feel like I&rsquo;m having fun right now, like I&rsquo;m building up a sustainable running practice, and I&rsquo;m learning a lot about what motivates me to keep going, and of which is worth it.</p>\n<p>And I can still run <em>one whole mile</em> without stopping. And that still does feel pretty cool!</p>\n<p>That said, I&rsquo;ve learned a bit about how goal motivated I am. Races‚Äîas much as I anguish over them‚Äîbring structure and focus to all the runs that come before them. So I&rsquo;m going to keep doing them, and I&rsquo;m planning on doing two more half-marathons in 2023. I want to re-run the Fall Classic in November, because I want to have at least one year-over-year apples-to-apples comparison, just to see what there is to see. Before that I want to try for a late spring race, I think, because I&rsquo;d like to run at least one of these races in (hopefully) nice weather. I&rsquo;ve earned that!</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m also ready to care about pace a little more. Admittedly, I ran the November race slow enough that it would be tough <em>not</em> to beat that time next time out, after another round of training, but also I just <em>know</em> I can go faster than that, and I want to specifically try for that. I never expect to be competitive at these things, nor am I interested in trying hard enough to be. But I also know it&rsquo;s fun to surprise yourself, and I can get behind trying hard enough for that. So I&rsquo;m setting out with the loose goal this spring of beating my first time, and then going for something reasonably ambitious in the fall.</p>\n<p>To that end, in the short term, I want to run more during the next training cycle. Not necessarily harder, but more. I know I trained at about the barest possible minimal level for the fall race. Next time out I want to go from three days a week to four. I think I&rsquo;m going to repeat the same basic 12-week training calendar as the last time out, which I liked the general feel of, with the addition of the fourth day, which would be a shorter, light/easy day. I have no plans to target five days as I want to keep a day or two free for an elliptical session or finding a strength training or yoga habit I like.</p>\n<p>While I said I don&rsquo;t necessarily want to run harder, I do generally want to bring my paces up across the board. Sometimes these last few months I felt fine, sometimes I felt like I had more to give but was holding back. I&rsquo;m still not quite sure what easy <em>should</em> actually feel like but I think just in general the more I run the more efficient I get and if I can maintain my consistency through into the new year I&rsquo;ll naturally feel a little more okay going a little more fast a little more often. Maybe more importantly though, for confidence purposes, I want to push my race pace experiments more aggressively. I want to pick an ambitious target early and stick with it the whole way through. I really wasn&rsquo;t sure what felt right this last time through, and now I think I want to use those runs to push myself to give a little more. Still, even if it&rsquo;s nothing like what I run on race day, having those faster days in the training cycle feels fun.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m also hoping to do some shorter races that I can really try for my best-possible paces. I&rsquo;m thinking about re-doing the 10k I ran last spring, which left me feeling like I had something unresolved there that I&rsquo;d like to make good on. I&rsquo;m also curious to see if I can beat my summer 5k race&rsquo;s time from last year, too. Which actually feels like it could be the most ambitious goal of the year! If I find some 10k races that fit in with the half marathon plans, I might try to slide those in, too, for practice purposes, but I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s going to work out or not.</p>\n<p>So that&rsquo;s the year in a nutshell, as I picture it right now: a half, some shorter stuff, and then a give-it-my-all half by the year&rsquo;s end. Working on confidence, pace, and strength. And then all going well, launching into full marathon training come January 2024.</p>\n",

I think I'm going to repeat the same basic 12-week training calendar as the last time out, which I liked the general feel of, with the addition of the fourth day, which would be a shorter, light/easy day. I have no plans to target five days as I want to keep a day or two free for an elliptical session or finding a strength training or yoga habit I like.\n\nWhile I said I don't necessarily want to run harder, I do generally want to bring my paces up across the board. Sometimes these last few months I felt fine, sometimes I felt like I had more to give but was holding back. I'm still not quite sure what easy *should* actually feel like but I think just in general the more I run the more efficient I get and if I can maintain my consistency through into the new year I'll naturally feel a little more okay going a little more fast a little more often. Maybe more importantly though, for confidence purposes, I want to push my race pace experiments more aggressively. I want to pick an ambitious target early and stick with it the whole way through. I really wasn't sure what felt right this last time through, and now I think I want to use those runs to push myself to give a little more. Still, even if it's nothing like what I run on race day, having those faster days in the training cycle feels fun. \n\nI'm also hoping to do some shorter races that I can really try for my best-possible paces. I'm thinking about re-doing the 10k I ran last spring, which left me feeling like I had something unresolved there that I'd like to make good on. I'm also curious to see if I can beat my summer 5k race's time from last year, too. Which actually feels like it could be the most ambitious goal of the year! If I find some 10k races that fit in with the half marathon plans, I might try to slide those in, too, for practice purposes, but I'm not sure that's going to work out or not.\n\nSo that's the year in a nutshell, as I picture it right now: a half, some shorter stuff, and then a give-it-my-all half by the year's end. Working on confidence, pace, and strength. And then all going well, launching into full marathon training come January 2024.\n",

I felt pretty spaced out before that, like I&rsquo;d been walking through a post-race cloud, and it was only when I started to come out of it that I felt like I could not just know I did it as a fact but feel that I did it as a truth. If that makes sense. Like I could feel the nervous energy start to dissipate into a sense of accomplishment. It made for a nice post-race high.</p>\n<p>That said: oh my lord, I have never before felt <em>cold</em> like I did right after that race.</p>\n<p>To back up a bit: the week before the race I continued my taper. It got a little weird! I&rsquo;d planned on Tuesday/Thursday runs like usual with super-easy Monday/Friday elliptical sessions, all basically just to keep loose while resting up. Monday went fine, then Tuesday fell apart for various reasons, including truly miserable weather, and I wound up cancelling. So then I went back out for a handful of miles Wednesday night, a few at &ldquo;race pace,&rdquo; then had to turn around and get up early on Friday to get one more run in before work and the weekend. It all worked out fine, and my fears of over-sleeping Friday came to nothing, but the whole stutter-step of a final week&rsquo;s schedule was <em>slightly</em> nerve-wracking.</p>\n<p>I felt good Friday, and slept like a baby that night, which was nice, because I knew I&rsquo;d probably <em>not</em> sleep like a baby the night before the race. (Spoiler alert: I did not sleep good Saturday night.) Saturday felt like one of the longest days of my life. I&rsquo;m learning just how susceptible I am to pre-race nerves. I know it&rsquo;s healthy to a degree, the body&rsquo;s way of getting amped up for the coming event. But I also think I was tipping a bit past &ldquo;excitement&rdquo; and more into &ldquo;bro, you <em>must chill</em>&rdquo; territory. I did not enjoy myself much that day. Again, everything worked out! But I know I want to work out a better day-before strategy for the future.</p>\n<p>Leading up to race day I was watching the weather forecast. Specifically, I was watching the forecasted temperature drop like a rock. Signing up for a late November race in northeast Ohio, I have some idea what I&rsquo;m getting myself into. But! Yikes! Based on my experience at the 5k at the same event last year, I was happily anticipating low-40s, gray clouds, maybe some fog. You know&hellip;perfect running weather. I was not prepared for the low 20s. With a wind chill that took it down to single-digit territory.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How cold was it,&rdquo; you ask? Could enough that I&rsquo;d never adequately had the chance to test race day gear‚ÄîI&rsquo;d run in three layers of clothing earlier that week, but decided at the last minute to throw on a fourth vest layer on top on my running fleece layer. Cold enough that every time I thought I was warmed up enough during the run that I could unzip those top two layers to vent, I was zipping back up within minutes. Cold enough that the water they were giving out on the course was actually freezing‚Äîat least, there were definitely ice chips in mine. Cold enough that a friend of mine said her water pack vest froze up on her, so she couldn&rsquo;t use it during the race. Like, this was not fun running cold. This was <em>real</em> cold. Did I need to score those extra bad-ass points my first time out? No. Did I, though? I guess so!</p>\n<p>The good news is the snow that hit near my house up by the lake was a non-issue to the south, and we got some beautiful (if heatless) sun for the entirety of the race, too. Good for keeping spirits up, at least. And yet, still, it was <em>cold</em> cold.</p>\n<p>As for how I did: I did it. If you&rsquo;ve been following along you know my one goal going into the run was to run the whole way and&hellip;I did that. I ran the whole way. I took full advantage of my &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about pace this time out&rdquo; mindset. My pace was way at the slowest end of my anticipated range, but I still came in just ahead of my &ldquo;Something probably went wrong&rdquo; time. I&rsquo;ll take it! I definitely went very conservative on pacing, as thoughts of burning out early were strong. And of course the weather this fall was way too kind, affording no appropriate lead-in down to race-day temperatures.</p>\n<p>All that said, there really were some nice stretches in the middle where the miles did kind of melt into each other. Five through eight, maybe? Things did get uglier as I went on, though. While I knew for a fact I could do it, I still felt like I had to dig in a bit to convince myself that I was <em>going</em> to do it. That it was going to be <em>way</em> more fun to be able to tell everyone afterward that I did in fact make it.

Not much in the way of spectators, of course, because of the weather and because of where the course was run.

I kept that pace right around where I‚Äôd kept it the week before, with relatively few ‚ÄúSlow down, dummy!‚Äù alerts from my watch, all the way through the fourth mile. It felt really good and also <em>oh gee</em> did I feel it afterward, all the way through Friday. (It wasn‚Äôt exactly concerning so much as I felt generally beat up.

My dream of the perfectly restorative night‚Äôs sleep didn‚Äôt pan out, and while I felt somewhat better this morning, I know I wasn‚Äôt back to one hundred percent, either. So I‚Äôm not surprised my average pace was slower than my last few long runs‚Ä¶but I <em>am</em> actually pleasantly surprised that I made it all twelve miles.

There‚Äôs minor things, weird things I‚Äôm maybe not getting into much, in the interest of keeping these updates somewhat brief, or maybe because I‚Äôm doing a bad job of writing down as much as I actually should.

In an effort to avoid the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go <em>extra</em> sort of fast for the last stretch‚Äù thing I‚Äôve been doing the last few weeks, I set my watch to just notify me when the three race pace miles were done, rather than notifying me at each mile. That helped, I think. I mean, it made the race pace segment feel very long, but it stayed pretty steady, which felt nice.</p>\n<p>And then of course ten miles came on Saturday morning, which had me out the door before sunrise. I kept the route generally more flat than the previous time I went out for ten miles. It felt long, but it also felt pretty good; certainly better than the week previous. I definitely felt like I needed to push myself to finish, a bit, near the end‚Äîten miles really is so many miles! I think it showed up in my pace graph; my first three miles were on my slower side, but then my last three miles were pretty fast, the last two actually edging into my hypothetical race pace range.

It‚Äôs more out of, in part, wanting to keep my situational awareness levels up, as I never run with others around me, and also, in part, because letting in spectator noise, picking up that energy, feels really cool; in the shorter races I‚Äôve done, it‚Äôs a huge part of what‚Äôs made the actual race feel like a real thing. Still, thirteen (point one!) miles is a long time to run without one of my primary crutches, and I wanted to take at least one test run ahead of time without music to make sure I actually could do it.

It felt so ambitious, back then. Little did I imagine when I&rsquo;d finally run it it would be totally chill weekday training. Training for a run more than three times longer than that one. No big deal. (Basically. I actually went maybe one notch harder than I probably should have.

This felt really good. This felt like the fun kind of tempo run/threshold run/&ldquo;this feels like a good workout&rdquo; run I remember from 5k training in the summer.

				"content_html": "<p>Okay! Week six! The build continues, with a nine mile run following last week‚Äôs eight miler. And it went swimmingly: without really trying, I managed to create the most beautiful pace graph ever, with every mile either at or a bit above the pace of the previous mile, right on through to the end. Even past the point around the start of mile seven when I started having mild doubts about whether or not I was even going to make it to the end. Cardiovascularly I was feeling pretty good, and my energy level was okay, though I was definitely <em>feeling</em> it‚Äîthe basic endurance required to just keep going for that long is truly something else‚Ä¶but oh gosh did my legs feel like I was trying to run nine miles for the first time a week after running eight miles for the first time. Not horrible, but not exactly strain-free, either! It‚Äôs possible there was some internal motivational screaming happening during mile eight. It‚Äôs possible there was some <em>audible</em> motivational screaming happening in mile nine. Possibly! Maybe! It‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm fine and definitely not crazy or weird.</p>\n<p>We‚Äôre at the point here near Cleveland where the temperature is starting to drop, which makes me start thinking really hard about <em>hey wait how the heck do I dress for these conditions again</em>? I‚Äôve been through enough of these cycles now that I‚Äôm going into this fall season knowing well that I just run hot, in general, doubly so when I‚Äôm actually running, and that whatever other people might be wearing, I‚Äôm going to be better off wearing <em>less</em> than what my rational mind tells me to wear. For today‚Äôs low-fifties-and-overcast run, that meant skipping the extra layers I was starting to think I should start thinking about piling on. Though I did upgrade from a thin running shirt to a merino running shirt! Short sleeves, though! Felt good, and once I warmed up a bit, it took stronger gusts to remind me that, hey, it was actually kind of chilly out there. But yeah, it‚Äôs probably time to think about pulling out the extra stuff.</p>\n<p>The easy four miler on Monday was‚Ä¶an easy four miles. I ran a weird route because I‚Äôve got this side thing going where I‚Äôm trying to run so that my heat map on Strava eventually indicates that I‚Äôve run every single street in Lakewood. Picked up a couple streets that I‚Äôd somehow skipped over to date. It‚Äôs a silly project but a fun way to force me to mix up my routes a bit, now and then. (There‚Äôs going to be some really weird runs in my future dedicated to logging time on weird little tiny side streets.)</p>\n<p>My pace race run on Wednesday, I was up to two miles of race pace running, for which I‚Äôd slid my target pace another thirty seconds faster from the week previous, and I landed both miles pretty close to the fastest end of that minute. And‚Ä¶yeah, I think it‚Äôs time to try to figure out how to consciously slide my pace back into the slower half of that minute. I think what I‚Äôm looking for is a pace where it feels like I‚Äôm running fast but not hard; the race pace portion of Wednesday‚Äôs run was fast, for me, but probably a bit too hard, for a sustainable long-distance effort. Or at least, I don‚Äôt feel compelled to try to maintain that pace for that long, not yet, not at this stage. I‚Äôm just not quite sure that I know how to fine-tune my pace to such a degree, yet, though I guess actually consciously trying to will be a good start!</p>\n<p>Which all brings me to the exact halfway point of this half-marathon training plan. At least in terms of weeks‚Äîthere‚Äôs a <em>lot</em> of miles to cover yet! Right now, today, eight hours after I finished my long run, I‚Äôm feeling pretty good about all this. I feel like, so long as I can keep my motivation up, I‚Äôm still on track to make it to that half-marathon finish line in something resembling one piece.

And it went swimmingly: without really trying, I managed to create the most beautiful pace graph ever, with every mile either at or a bit above the pace of the previous mile, right on through to the end. Even past the point around the start of mile seven when I started having mild doubts about whether or not I was even going to make it to the end. Cardiovascularly I was feeling pretty good, and my energy level was okay, though I was definitely *feeling* it‚Äîthe basic endurance required to just keep going for that long is truly something else‚Ä¶but oh gosh did my legs feel like I was trying to run nine miles for the first time a week after running eight miles for the first time. Not horrible, but not exactly strain-free, either! It‚Äôs possible there was some internal motivational screaming happening during mile eight. It‚Äôs possible there was some *audible* motivational screaming happening in mile nine. Possibly! Maybe! It‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm fine and definitely not crazy or weird.\n\nWe‚Äôre at the point here near Cleveland where the temperature is starting to drop, which makes me start thinking really hard about *hey wait how the heck do I dress for these conditions again*? I‚Äôve been through enough of these cycles now that I‚Äôm going into this fall season knowing well that I just run hot, in general, doubly so when I‚Äôm actually running, and that whatever other people might be wearing, I‚Äôm going to be better off wearing *less* than what my rational mind tells me to wear. For today‚Äôs low-fifties-and-overcast run, that meant skipping the extra layers I was starting to think I should start thinking about piling on. Though I did upgrade from a thin running shirt to a merino running shirt! Short sleeves, though! Felt good, and once I warmed up a bit, it took stronger gusts to remind me that, hey, it was actually kind of chilly out there. But yeah, it‚Äôs probably time to think about pulling out the extra stuff. \n\nThe easy four miler on Monday was‚Ä¶an easy four miles. I ran a weird route because I‚Äôve got this side thing going where I‚Äôm trying to run so that my heat map on Strava eventually indicates that I‚Äôve run every single street in Lakewood. Picked up a couple streets that I‚Äôd somehow skipped over to date. It‚Äôs a silly project but a fun way to force me to mix up my routes a bit, now and then. (There‚Äôs going to be some really weird runs in my future dedicated to logging time on weird little tiny side streets.)\n\nMy pace race run on Wednesday, I was up to two miles of race pace running, for which I‚Äôd slid my target pace another thirty seconds faster from the week previous, and I landed both miles pretty close to the fastest end of that minute. And‚Ä¶yeah, I think it‚Äôs time to try to figure out how to consciously slide my pace back into the slower half of that minute. I think what I‚Äôm looking for is a pace where it feels like I‚Äôm running fast but not hard; the race pace portion of Wednesday‚Äôs run was fast, for me, but probably a bit too hard, for a sustainable long-distance effort. Or at least, I don‚Äôt feel compelled to try to maintain that pace for that long, not yet, not at this stage. I‚Äôm just not quite sure that I know how to fine-tune my pace to such a degree, yet, though I guess actually consciously trying to will be a good start!\n\nWhich all brings me to the exact halfway point of this half-marathon training plan. At least in terms of weeks‚Äîthere‚Äôs a *lot* of miles to cover yet! Right now, today, eight hours after I finished my long run, I‚Äôm feeling pretty good about all this. I feel like, so long as I can keep my motivation up, I‚Äôm still on track to make it to that half-marathon finish line in something resembling one piece. Knock on wood, fingers crossed, all that good stuff‚Ä¶.\n",

Then I finished strong. My last mile was my fastest.

				"content_html": "<p>I‚Äôd flagged this week as the start of my build phase, but now I think it was maybe my last ‚Äúgimme‚Äù week‚Äîthere wasn&rsquo;t anything in the plan I haven&rsquo;t done before and it was mostly a question of doing it <em>now</em> as proof that I could be ready in time for what comes next. So I guess I&rsquo;ll call it a transition week?</p>\n<p>My long run on Saturday was seven miles. I&rsquo;ve done seven before, a handful of times, and I felt comfortable taking it on this time, even keeping an average pace a notch faster than last week‚Äôs six miler. The weather didn&rsquo;t hurt‚Äîpicture-perfect for running, overcast, low 60s, some breeze. In the past every time I&rsquo;ve hit this kind of distance I think I&rsquo;ve started to realize just how much the long run game is a mental one as it is a physical one. Running at a comfortable pace means feeling like I could, theoretically, physically do it forever; convincing myself, mentally, over and over again, that that is actually a good idea, a valid use of my time, <em>and</em> the actual goal is&hellip;weird. Realizing that Saturday&rsquo;s <em>last</em> mile was going to be my <em>middle</em> mile during the half marathon in eight weeks was also quite the rude perspective shift!</p>\n<p>Thursday was the first &ldquo;race pace&rdquo; run. A mile warm up, a mile cool down, a race pace mile sandwiched in the middle. (Hold the mayo.) (Yes, I&rsquo;m a dad, have I mentioned that yet?) I&rsquo;d set a minute-long pace range that I wanted to maintain for that middle mile that was meant to feel like a stretch while also giving me plenty of leeway to make it feel right.

				"content_text": "I‚Äôd flagged this week as the start of my build phase, but now I think it was maybe my last ‚Äúgimme‚Äù week‚Äîthere wasn't anything in the plan I haven't done before and it was mostly a question of doing it *now* as proof that I could be ready in time for what comes next. So I guess I'll call it a transition week?\n\nMy long run on Saturday was seven miles. I've done seven before, a handful of times, and I felt comfortable taking it on this time, even keeping an average pace a notch faster than last week‚Äôs six miler. The weather didn't hurt‚Äîpicture-perfect for running, overcast, low 60s, some breeze. In the past every time I've hit this kind of distance I think I've started to realize just how much the long run game is a mental one as it is a physical one. Running at a comfortable pace means feeling like I could, theoretically, physically do it forever; convincing myself, mentally, over and over again, that that is actually a good idea, a valid use of my time, *and* the actual goal is...weird. Realizing that Saturday's *last* mile was going to be my *middle* mile during the half marathon in eight weeks was also quite the rude perspective shift!\n\nThursday was the first \"race pace\" run. A mile warm up, a mile cool down, a race pace mile sandwiched in the middle. (Hold the mayo.) (Yes, I'm a dad, have I mentioned that yet?) I'd set a minute-long pace range that I wanted to maintain for that middle mile that was meant to feel like a stretch while also giving me plenty of leeway to make it feel right. Turns out what felt right was a pace fifteen seconds *faster* than my target range. It felt good! It felt good to open back up some for the first time since the 5k; it was nice to feel like I hadn't completely lost all the gains I made during that training period. Now, I really don't believe the pace I ran Thursday was something I could actually maintain for 13 (and an oh and a point and a one-zero) miles; I mean, maybe it is, maybe I'm holding myself back, I know I'm perpetually concerned about over-doing it. (As my wife has put it, \"Darby is very aware of his limits.\") I don't know. Either way, I do like those fast-but-not-absurd runs, and I've missed them since finishing the 5k training. Having that variety in the week is fun, a little spicy. I think I can safely slide my original target pace range forward by about 30 seconds. We'll see what happens.\n\nTuesday night's easy run continued the trend out of the previous week of my easy pace naturally starting to lift; it felt more like the race pace I expected to do on Thursday night (which probably translated to me pushing that mile faster on Thursday). I think I was running off some stress, too. Either way: faster than expected. Not the third-in-a-row ultra-low-heart-rate-Tuesday-run in a row I was on the lookout for, which is fine.\n\nLooking ahead, things definitely actually for-*real*-real get interesting the next three weeks. I add a mile a week to the long runs each week (three weeks of new longest runs ever!), and a half mile a week to the race pace segment on Thursdays; Tuesdays will lock in at four miles for a while.

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about trying a half marathon‚Äîand, yes, a full marathon‚Äîfor a while now. Now, I&rsquo;m actually planning on going after my first half marathon at the <a href=\"https://www.clewestrunningclub.org/fall-classic.html\">Fall Classic</a> in Cleveland on November 22.</p>\n<p>Why now? I&rsquo;ve been running for three years now, pretty consistently for the last year, and I still like it, I want to keep doing it, and I think I&rsquo;m in a good position to go for it. Coming off the 5k in July I know that having a challenge like that in front of me helps put the day-to-day activity into a framework that helps me keep my interest levels up. Also, I&rsquo;m 44, and while I know I&rsquo;ve got plenty of potential running years ahead of me should I choose to accept them, I also know I&rsquo;m not getting any younger, so if I&rsquo;ve got even a flicker of interest in it, now&rsquo;s probably the time to go for it.</p>\n<p>I will also say that my goals here are all very soft. I know well that anything from cataclysmic injury to flagging interest in the face of the demanding commitment could derail the whole process and that&rsquo;s fine. If I make it, I want it to feel incredible, and if I don&rsquo;t, I want to remember that I&rsquo;m still running and have run more miles in this lifetime than I may ever have expected I would.</p>\n<p>All that said, my ultimate goal, of course, is to tackle a full marathon. I&rsquo;ve been toying with some plans for a bit now and I think my best bet is start off with a half marathon in November, another in May 2023, and a third in November 2023, before moving on to the full marathon in May 2024. Assuming I&rsquo;m still healthy! And happy! And that there&rsquo;s still land to run on that hasn&rsquo;t been covered by the sea. I think this gives me the chance to build up my confidence and experiment with training approaches and intensities, while still pacing things out in a way so that it stays fun. I don&rsquo;t need to rush it and make myself miserable, but I don&rsquo;t want the big goal to be total vaporware.</p>\n<p>For this first half marathon, my only goal right now is to run the whole thing without needing walking breaks. I don&rsquo;t want to set a firm time goal, though I&rsquo;m <em>guessing</em> I could land it somewhere between 2:15 and 2:30, if I can maintain a healthy pace for the duration. That said, I took walking breaks during my first 5k in 2019, and during my first 10k earlier this year, and even if I&rsquo;m running like a dream in the weeks leading up to the half marathon, I know there&rsquo;s a swell chance race-day nerves will kick in and I&rsquo;ll wind up coming out hot and I&rsquo;ll need to compensate later. Which will be perfectly fine‚Äîall the more reason for giving myself at least three attempts at the half distance before going on to full as I work on figuring out how to tame that tendency.</p>\n<p>For my training schedule, I&rsquo;m going somewhat softly this first time, more softly in some ways than I did for the 5k in July. I&rsquo;m taking a hybrid of <a href=\"https://www.verywellfit.com/half-marathon-training-schedule-for-beginners-2911618\">this beginner&rsquo;s plan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.verywellfit.com/advanced-beginner-half-marathon-training-schedule-2911617\">this advanced beginer&rsquo;s plan</a>. I&rsquo;m taking the slightly more aggressive cadence of the advanced beginner&rsquo;s plan for the Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday runs, but I&rsquo;m swapping out the Sunday easy run in favor of cross-training, as suggested by the beginner&rsquo;s plan.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m going with the higher-mileage plan just because because I feel like I can do it, and that those few extra miles each week will help me feel more confident going into the race. Generally the miles will be easier miles than I did training for the 5k‚Äîlike, no hard interval runs, this time out, and my &ldquo;race pace&rdquo; runs I <em>think</em> will be less intense than my threshhold runs from the 5k training plan. Mostly I want to continue educating my body about what my &ldquo;next gear&rdquo; feels like, to try to get some better sense of what sustainable and potential trouble each feel like. Honestly, pace in general is a huge question mark for me, right now, which is all the more reason to treat this first attempt as an educational experiment.</p>\n<p>As for the extra cross-training day on Sundays, while I was running four days a week training for the 5k, while I&rsquo;m really excited to know I can do that, I kind of want to keep that in reserve for next time. If this first round goes well, introducing the fourth day again next time should be an easy way to help me improve from there. I do also wonder if it was maybe a shade too much, what with including hard intervals and fairly hard threshhold runs in the mix. I&rsquo;m still working my confidence back up after the mild knee injury I developed during the race and I&rsquo;m not looking to aggravate that just yet. So aside from just, you know, taking it easy on my joints, I&rsquo;ve also started getting out on my bicycles again, which has felt really nice, and I&rsquo;m happy to use cross-training as an excuse to keep putting some easy miles in on the wheels.</p>\n<p>All that said, I can&rsquo;t lie‚ÄîI&rsquo;m certainly already second-guessing myself, here.

That‚Äôs the post-race thought.</p>\n<p>As for my thoughts about the thought&hellip;</p>\n<p>Before this, any time I&rsquo;ve raced, it&rsquo;s just been to finish, to cross the finish line. This was the first time I‚Äôve trained and raced with a specific time goal. I&rsquo;m glad I went through this experiment, and not just because the training pushed me to crush my goal time. I feel like I learned a lot from it, about my range and capabilities as a runner; the effort made me stronger, the edges of my comfort zones pushed back a a couple notches, at least. And of course it kept me on track to keep running through the first hot part of summer.</p>\n<p>Of course, ultimately crushing the goal time was like throwing a perfect cherry on top of the sundae&hellip;and then throwing an entire second sundae on top of that. All I <em>needed</em> to do to feel succesful was to beat my goal time by at least one second. To come in around three minutes under that time was right up there at the top end of my most optimistic, pie-in-the-sky, head-in-the-cloud secret goals.</p>\n<p>My strategy for the run itself was to try to just <em>know</em> that I could do it, that I‚Äôd trained hard enough that I could just let my race day adrenaline do its thing. I pictured myself keeping things smooth but swift for the first two or so miles, so that I&rsquo;d be able to go all-out the last half-mile, but of course, my race day nerves had other plans, and I did almost the opposite of that, with a fast, hard first mile, and a second mile that wasn&rsquo;t too far off.</p>\n<p>After that&hellip;I knew I was running fast and hard, but I didn&rsquo;t really know by how much. (I&rsquo;d made the conscious choice not to check my watch at all during the run, because I didn&rsquo;t want to psych myself out mid-race.) Rounding mile two I knew getting to the end was going to be as much a mental game as a physical one (oh, but it was still deeply, intensely physical!). Telling myself that whole last mile that I didn‚Äôt need to stop, that it wasn&rsquo;t time to stop yet, that I didn‚Äôt even <em>want</em> to stop, despite all the extremely hard and compelling evidence my body was throwing at me with each breath, was pretty much everything.</p>\n<p>Suffice it to say, that planned last half mile kick-up wasn&rsquo;t in the cards.. I knew I was already leaving everything out there I could, and the only thing left was to dig deep and keep going. Overall, my last mile was my slowest of the three, but the funny thing in retrospect is, is that it was still one of the three fastest complete miles I&rsquo;ve run maybe ever. &ldquo;Slowing down&rdquo; to what was still a ridiculously fast mile, for me? Priceless.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s funny to think about now, but at the time, it really felt like time and space were starting todo really weird things that final stretch. That last half mile straight-away up Belle Ave grew longer the further away from Lake Erie I ran. Someone kept moving the train tracks that crossed the mid-point kept moving away from me. The road was in fact rising to meet me&hellip;by becoming a mountain directly in front of my face.</p>\n<p>And then somewhere past the tracks‚Äîactually, it&rsquo;s been days since the race and I&rsquo;m still not convinced I&rsquo;ve reached those tracks yet, but I digress‚Äîamid the noise of the street festival past the finish line and the folks cheering for the runners alongside the course‚Äîthe cheers of strangers are, truly, gifts‚Äîthere was a guy walking down the sidewalk reading numbers out loud off his phone, <em>twenty-six something</em>, <em>twenty-six something plus one</em>, <em>twenty-six something plus two</em>, and time really did actually slow down for a moment, and I slipped out of my body, and I processed this information, and I realized that I wasn‚Äôt just about to reach my goal‚Äîthis big, dumb, stupid, pointless goal I‚Äôd set for myself two months earlier, that I&rsquo;d been quietly obsessing over for eight weeks‚Äîbut that I was about to obliterate it, and that realization slammed be back down into my body, and I somehow ran <em>harder</em>.</p>\n<p>I may never run like that again. But to feel the <em>something else</em> that lies just below the <em>nothing left</em> briefly take over? To feel that even once was a privilege and a delight. And then going from that to crossing the finish line, running straight into my family‚Äîmy poor family, having my sweat-drenched, hyperventilating form collapsing all over them‚Äîwas just perfect.</p>\n",

Telling myself that whole last mile that I didn‚Äôt need to stop, that it wasn't time to stop yet, that I didn‚Äôt even _want_ to stop, despite all the extremely hard and compelling evidence my body was throwing at me with each breath, was pretty much everything.\n\nSuffice it to say, that planned last half mile kick-up wasn't in the cards.. I knew I was already leaving everything out there I could, and the only thing left was to dig deep and keep going. Overall, my last mile was my slowest of the three, but the funny thing in retrospect is, is that it was still one of the three fastest complete miles I've run maybe ever. \"Slowing down\" to what was still a ridiculously fast mile, for me? Priceless.\n\nIt's funny to think about now, but at the time, it really felt like time and space were starting todo really weird things that final stretch. That last half mile straight-away up Belle Ave grew longer the further away from Lake Erie I ran. Someone kept moving the train tracks that crossed the mid-point kept moving away from me. The road was in fact rising to meet me...by becoming a mountain directly in front of my face.\n\nAnd then somewhere past the tracks‚Äîactually, it's been days since the race and I'm still not convinced I've reached those tracks yet, but I digress‚Äîamid the noise of the street festival past the finish line and the folks cheering for the runners alongside the course‚Äîthe cheers of strangers are, truly, gifts‚Äîthere was a guy walking down the sidewalk reading numbers out loud off his phone, _twenty-six something_, _twenty-six something plus one_, _twenty-six something plus two_, and time really did actually slow down for a moment, and I slipped out of my body, and I processed this information, and I realized that I wasn‚Äôt just about to reach my goal‚Äîthis big, dumb, stupid, pointless goal I‚Äôd set for myself two months earlier, that I'd been quietly obsessing over for eight weeks‚Äîbut that I was about to obliterate it, and that realization slammed be back down into my body, and I somehow ran _harder_.\n\nI may never run like that again. But to feel the _something else_ that lies just below the _nothing left_ briefly take over? To feel that even once was a privilege and a delight. And then going from that to crossing the finish line, running straight into my family‚Äîmy poor family, having my sweat-drenched, hyperventilating form collapsing all over them‚Äîwas just perfect.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I was chatting with a friend of mine about running, and she suggested she might come back to me for training plan advice, which is hilarious because nobody should ask me for advice about anything, ever. That said, that conversation prompted me to think I should probably brain-dump what I&rsquo;ve learned over the last eight weeks, while it&rsquo;s top of mind, even if only for my own reference later.</p>\n<p>Long story short: I ran my first official 10k in May, at which point I realized I had exactly 8 weeks to go before my next race, a 5k. I&rsquo;ve been running for about 3 years at this point, though I didn&rsquo;t get really consistent with it until about last September, after completely bottoming out last summer. Coming out of this stretch of consistency, I was concerned about the summer‚ÄîI did so well during the winter, would I lose all my progress when the summer heat hit? Having a formal short-term goal on top of a real training plan felt like a good way to keep my motivation and momentum up.</p>\n<p>So, I set the goal of not just making it to the 5k, but PRing at it&hellip;even if only by one second. Up to this point I&rsquo;ve mostly tried to look at speed and pace as interesting but not important. I&rsquo;m too old to need to go fast. My goals this year have been more around consistency and racking up a certain number of miles over the course of the year. But, given how I&rsquo;ve felt lately and the level consistency I&rsquo;ve maintained, speed has felt like something interesting I could play with. I&rsquo;ve felt like I <em>could</em> consciously boost my pace a bit, even if only for one race. So I decided to go for it, knowing once the race is behind me I can happily revert to easier runs to ride out the rest of the summer.</p>\n<p>Training plans for running are a dime a dozen. After searching for one intended to help improve a 5k race time, <a href=\"https://www.verywellfit.com/5k-intermediate-run-training-2911620\">I found this one at Verywell Fit</a>, which felt <em>right</em>, for me, like something I could apply to my current situation with some ease.</p>\n<p>I say <em>apply</em> because I had no intention of following any plan to the letter, instead choosing to freely adjust it to meet my needs. I dropped the plan back to 4 runs a week rather than 5; up to that point I was still generally running only 3 times a week, and jumping to 5 felt like a bad idea. I&rsquo;ve been interested in trying to get an extra run in during the week, though, so it felt like 4 runs a week was a comfortable stretch I was ready to try to make.</p>\n<p>I kept what I thought of as the three core runs‚Äîthe interval run (or, &ldquo;the one with lots of extremely short, stupidly fast runs&rdquo;), the tempo run (or, &ldquo;the one with the mid-length, maintainably swift run&rdquo;), and the long, slow run (or, &ldquo;the one with the I-feel-like-I-could-literally-do-this-forever run&rdquo;)‚Äîbecause I wanted to formally experiment with speed while also consciously slowing down my long run.</p>\n<p>A little back story on that last point: leading up to the 10k in May I realized that I was kind of just going out and doing the same run all the time, generally going fast-for-me every time, and while I was getting faster, it also felt unsustainable. I wasn&rsquo;t playing with all the keys on the piano. Reading around online I kept seeing the same refrain about how most of your training run time should really be lighter, slower, more at a conversational pace. So even before I started the plan I was trying to learn how to slow down more often; with the plan, dedicating a couple runs each week to speed also meant trying my hardest to keep my other runs more low-key, either by pace or heart rate.</p>\n<p>All told, all of this pushed me to broaden my sense of my range as a runner‚Äîwhich, yes, calling myself a &ldquo;runner&rdquo; makes me feel like a huge imposter, still, sure‚Äîto really see what I was capable of at the upper and lower ends of my dials, and to start playing around a bit more with my sense of control and feel. Should I choose to focus on speed, like I plan to do at this race, I have a better sense of what healthy speed feels like and how very bad uh-oh-bad-idea speed can feel, the difference between the pace that can get me through the first two-thirds of the race and the pace I can throw at the last half mile because there&rsquo;s no reason to hold anything back because I will never ever ever have to run ever again for as long as I live as soon as I hit that finish line (at least until I go out again for my next run sometime after the race). Whatever happens at the race, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve bettered my sense of feel.</p>\n<p>As I said above I did introduce a fourth easy run to my week. With interval runs on Tuesday, tempo runs on Thursday, and my long run on Saturday, I put the easy run on Monday, thinking to give myself a rest day after my long run day (and a free night to enjoy an adult beverage or two on Saturdays, after that long run!). This worked for me, there was a nice rhythm to the week, and I&rsquo;m hoping after the race to keep the fourth run going, after a couple super easy recovery weeks. I might move it back to Sundays, to the weekend, because holy moly do the weeks feel <em>full</em> right now, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>\n<p>I liked the rhythm of having at most two runs two days in a row, for me, where I&rsquo;m at now. There was one week where I did have to move my Monday easy run to Wednesday, and while I did it, while I made three days in a row work that one time, and I actually did pretty well on that Thursday tempo run, I think I still prefer the more steady rate of rest days between run days. It definitely caught up to me in the fays that followed. I&rsquo;m not there yet, at least not with those fairly intense runs in the mix.</p>\n<p>I did little cross-training, because time is hard, though I did try to make sure I walked at least one good solid mile every day to help keep things loose, either as a lunchtime break or just around parks trying to keep up with my two kids. It&rsquo;s not much, but it&rsquo;s something. Again, unless the Olympics open up to middle-aged guys who drink beer for fun, what I&rsquo;m doing right now is just fine, thanks.</p>\n<p>I also found a yoga routine that I liked, which occupied Wednesday nights. I&rsquo;m pretty hooked on that now. The one time I skipped that was the one week where I had some pain that tipped from &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an old man and I&rsquo;m naturally creaky and of course I hurt but it&rsquo;s, like, a <em>good</em> hurt&rdquo; over to &ldquo;Oh no, my body is 75 percent broken-down rusty old cars and 25 percent small woodland creatures making their homes inside those cars.&rdquo; That week I had to skip my tempo run and shorten my long run; that little bit of recovery space cleared the way for a strong finish, though, letting me land my first (and last, for a while!) 20+ mile week ever just last week.</p>\n<p>All in all, the training plan itself went pretty well. I liked making the plan and then following it‚Äîdoing 90 percent of the thinking up front, mostly, and then just doing the doing after that. For the most part, at least. I definitely felt free to modify details as I went based on what I learned along the way. I learned a bit about when I&rsquo;m better doing a run by pace instead of heart rate; how to set my watch to give me useful information instead of just constantly screaming at me the whole time that I, a total hobbyist, was unable to consistently keep a completely consistent tempo within a narrow 20 second range; when to go a little harder and when to ease up.</p>\n<p>On the flip side&hellip;putting all this time toward one specific goal that&rsquo;s going to happen in a single half-hour timespan early on a single Saturday evening is a weird headspace to be in. That&rsquo;s the mental game, though. I tell myself that what actually happens at the race doesn&rsquo;t matter‚ÄîI could absolutely flub it and have the worst run of my life, and it wouldn&rsquo;t matter one bit, because the process of getting to that point, the work and improvements I&rsquo;ve enjoyed leading up to the race, that&rsquo;s the part that really matters for me.</p>\n<p>Which is a very nice thing to tell myself! And it might even be true! Still, though, obviously, of course I&rsquo;d be lying if I said that reaching that goal, perhaps even crushing it, reaching one of the <em>secret goals</em> I have locked away inside my brain for fear of ruining them by even thinking of speaking them aloud, doesn&rsquo;t actually matter to me at all. It does. Doing the thing would obviously be the incredibly delightful cherry to drop on top of this sundae. The sundae doesn&rsquo;t really need it, but it sure would look nice, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve got a couple easy runs ahead of me this week, a couple extra rest days, and then it&rsquo;s race day. My hope is that I&rsquo;ve both learned a few things that will help me run a better race than I have in the past, and that I&rsquo;ve also conditioned my system enough so that I comfortably take all my extra race-day adrenaline and pour it all out onto the race course. Whatever happens, it&rsquo;s not going to matter, but also, I feel pretty good about what could happen.</p>\n<p>Once I actually get to do the thing. Can I just do it right now? Get it over with? That&rsquo;d be nice. No? No? Darn. Worth the ask, anyway.</p>\n",
