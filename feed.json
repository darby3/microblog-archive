There were other factors at play, sure, but also, it was stupid and running was stupid and I quit.</p>\n<p>Turns out, sometimes quitting is smart. I needed to walk away from my running-induced frustrations for a while. After clearing my head, I realized running wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> stupid. And that I wasn&rsquo;t ready to quit.</p>\n<p>So I started back up September with a nice easy 1 mile run.</p>\n<p>And <em>then</em> I kept running.</p>\n<p>Not every specific run has been fun, obviously, but running itself has been fun in general.

Who knew! Doing the thing means you can do the thing! And I’m pretty sure I have gotten better at doing the thing, too.

This race happens in shouting distance of my house and I&rsquo;ve wanted to do it since I started running.

It felt like a good time to experiment with my running schedule and explore different kinds of runs, with the goal of getting my speed up, even just a quarter-notch or so, in order to try to set a new 5k PR at the race. Lo and behold, I found <a href=\"https://www.verywellfit.com/5k-intermediate-run-training-2911620\">a training plan that catered exactly to that</a>.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m about halfway through this 8 week session. I think it&rsquo;s been going well! I stepped that plan back slightly at the outset—before this I was only running 3 days a week; and 5 felt like it would have been too much of a jump, especially for an old man like me, but 4 felt like a nice, attainable stretch goal, a limit I could get behind pushing. So I&rsquo;m following the interval run, tempo run, and long run routine, with an extra easy run mixed in there.</p>\n<p>This has smoothly but also dramatically pushed my weekly mileage up each week from where I was around the time of the 10k. It&rsquo;s also varied the kinds of miles I&rsquo;m running, which has been educational. Consciously doing &ldquo;easier&rdquo; miles has felt weird, even for someone who doesn&rsquo;t really go all that fast when he&rsquo;s going his fastest, but getting a broader sense of my range, a greater feel for what I can do (run 0.25 mile sprint at a sub-7:30 pace!) and can’t do (run a 0.25 mile sprint at a sub-7:30 pace if I’m going to do more than a few of those sprints in a single session!) has been interesting. It&rsquo;s fun to know what my hardest-run interval feels like, compared to those easy-breezy I-could-do-this-forever slow-boat long-run miles.
