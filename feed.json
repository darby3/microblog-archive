It felt good to open back up some for the first time since the 5k; it was nice to feel like I hadn&rsquo;t completely lost all the gains I made during that training period. Now, I really don&rsquo;t believe the pace I ran Thursday was something I could actually maintain for 13 (and an oh and a point and a one-zero) miles; I mean, maybe it is, maybe I&rsquo;m holding myself back, I know I&rsquo;m perpetually concerned about over-doing it. (As my wife has put it, &ldquo;Darby is very aware of his limits.&quot;) I don&rsquo;t know.

Also, <em>Returnal</em> comes from Housemarque, which was responsible for <em>Resogun</em>, probably one of my top ten favorite games ever. So, I mean, it&rsquo;s an instant gotta-try game.

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about trying a half marathon‚Äîand, yes, a full marathon‚Äîfor a while now. Now, I&rsquo;m actually planning on going after my first half marathon at the <a href=\"https://www.clewestrunningclub.org/fall-classic.html\">Fall Classic</a> in Cleveland on November 22.</p>\n<p>Why now? I&rsquo;ve been running for three years now, pretty consistently for the last year, and I still like it, I want to keep doing it, and I think I&rsquo;m in a good position to go for it. Coming off the 5k in July I know that having a challenge like that in front of me helps put the day-to-day activity into a framework that helps me keep my interest levels up. Also, I&rsquo;m 44, and while I know I&rsquo;ve got plenty of potential running years ahead of me should I choose to accept them, I also know I&rsquo;m not getting any younger, so if I&rsquo;ve got even a flicker of interest in it, now&rsquo;s probably the time to go for it.</p>\n<p>I will also say that my goals here are all very soft. I know well that anything from cataclysmic injury to flagging interest in the face of the demanding commitment could derail the whole process and that&rsquo;s fine. If I make it, I want it to feel incredible, and if I don&rsquo;t, I want to remember that I&rsquo;m still running and have run more miles in this lifetime than I may ever have expected I would.</p>\n<p>All that said, my ultimate goal, of course, is to tackle a full marathon. I&rsquo;ve been toying with some plans for a bit now and I think my best bet is start off with a half marathon in November, another in May 2023, and a third in November 2023, before moving on to the full marathon in May 2024. Assuming I&rsquo;m still healthy! And happy! And that there&rsquo;s still land to run on that hasn&rsquo;t been covered by the sea. I think this gives me the chance to build up my confidence and experiment with training approaches and intensities, while still pacing things out in a way so that it stays fun. I don&rsquo;t need to rush it and make myself miserable, but I don&rsquo;t want the big goal to be total vaporware.</p>\n<p>For this first half marathon, my only goal right now is to run the whole thing without needing walking breaks. I don&rsquo;t want to set a firm time goal, though I&rsquo;m <em>guessing</em> I could land it somewhere between 2:15 and 2:30, if I can maintain a healthy pace for the duration. That said, I took walking breaks during my first 5k in 2019, and during my first 10k earlier this year, and even if I&rsquo;m running like a dream in the weeks leading up to the half marathon, I know there&rsquo;s a swell chance race-day nerves will kick in and I&rsquo;ll wind up coming out hot and I&rsquo;ll need to compensate later. Which will be perfectly fine‚Äîall the more reason for giving myself at least three attempts at the half distance before going on to full as I work on figuring out how to tame that tendency.</p>\n<p>For my training schedule, I&rsquo;m going somewhat softly this first time, more softly in some ways than I did for the 5k in July. I&rsquo;m taking a hybrid of <a href=\"https://www.verywellfit.com/half-marathon-training-schedule-for-beginners-2911618\">this beginner&rsquo;s plan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.verywellfit.com/advanced-beginner-half-marathon-training-schedule-2911617\">this advanced beginer&rsquo;s plan</a>. I&rsquo;m taking the slightly more aggressive cadence of the advanced beginner&rsquo;s plan for the Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday runs, but I&rsquo;m swapping out the Sunday easy run in favor of cross-training, as suggested by the beginner&rsquo;s plan.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m going with the higher-mileage plan just because because I feel like I can do it, and that those few extra miles each week will help me feel more confident going into the race. Generally the miles will be easier miles than I did training for the 5k‚Äîlike, no hard interval runs, this time out, and my &ldquo;race pace&rdquo; runs I <em>think</em> will be less intense than my threshhold runs from the 5k training plan. Mostly I want to continue educating my body about what my &ldquo;next gear&rdquo; feels like, to try to get some better sense of what sustainable and potential trouble each feel like. Honestly, pace in general is a huge question mark for me, right now, which is all the more reason to treat this first attempt as an educational experiment.</p>\n<p>As for the extra cross-training day on Sundays, while I was running four days a week training for the 5k, while I&rsquo;m really excited to know I can do that, I kind of want to keep that in reserve for next time. If this first round goes well, introducing the fourth day again next time should be an easy way to help me improve from there. I do also wonder if it was maybe a shade too much, what with including hard intervals and fairly hard threshhold runs in the mix. I&rsquo;m still working my confidence back up after the mild knee injury I developed during the race and I&rsquo;m not looking to aggravate that just yet. So aside from just, you know, taking it easy on my joints, I&rsquo;ve also started getting out on my bicycles again, which has felt really nice, and I&rsquo;m happy to use cross-training as an excuse to keep putting some easy miles in on the wheels.</p>\n<p>All that said, I can&rsquo;t lie‚ÄîI&rsquo;m certainly already second-guessing myself, here. Was it a mistake to tell everyone so early that I&rsquo;m trying this? Is it a mistakle to try this at all? Is this actually already happening, is this real, am I really doing my first official training runs this week? I guess there&rsquo;s only one way to answer these questions.</p>\n",

Honestly, pace in general is a huge question mark for me, right now, which is all the more reason to treat this first attempt as an educational experiment.\n\nAs for the extra cross-training day on Sundays, while I was running four days a week training for the 5k, while I'm really excited to know I can do that, I kind of want to keep that in reserve for next time. If this first round goes well, introducing the fourth day again next time should be an easy way to help me improve from there. I do also wonder if it was maybe a shade too much, what with including hard intervals and fairly hard threshhold runs in the mix. I'm still working my confidence back up after the mild knee injury I developed during the race and I'm not looking to aggravate that just yet. So aside from just, you know, taking it easy on my joints, I've also started getting out on my bicycles again, which has felt really nice, and I'm happy to use cross-training as an excuse to keep putting some easy miles in on the wheels.\n\nAll that said, I can't lie‚ÄîI'm certainly already second-guessing myself, here. Was it a mistake to tell everyone so early that I'm trying this? Is it a mistakle to try this at all? Is this actually already happening, is this real, am I really doing my first official training runs this week? I guess there's only one way to answer these questions.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I was chatting with a friend of mine about running, and she suggested she might come back to me for training plan advice, which is hilarious because nobody should ask me for advice about anything, ever. That said, that conversation prompted me to think I should probably brain-dump what I&rsquo;ve learned over the last eight weeks, while it&rsquo;s top of mind, even if only for my own reference later.</p>\n<p>Long story short: I ran my first official 10k in May, at which point I realized I had exactly 8 weeks to go before my next race, a 5k. I&rsquo;ve been running for about 3 years at this point, though I didn&rsquo;t get really consistent with it until about last September, after completely bottoming out last summer. Coming out of this stretch of consistency, I was concerned about the summer‚ÄîI did so well during the winter, would I lose all my progress when the summer heat hit? Having a formal short-term goal on top of a real training plan felt like a good way to keep my motivation and momentum up.</p>\n<p>So, I set the goal of not just making it to the 5k, but PRing at it&hellip;even if only by one second. Up to this point I&rsquo;ve mostly tried to look at speed and pace as interesting but not important. I&rsquo;m too old to need to go fast. My goals this year have been more around consistency and racking up a certain number of miles over the course of the year. But, given how I&rsquo;ve felt lately and the level consistency I&rsquo;ve maintained, speed has felt like something interesting I could play with. I&rsquo;ve felt like I <em>could</em> consciously boost my pace a bit, even if only for one race. So I decided to go for it, knowing once the race is behind me I can happily revert to easier runs to ride out the rest of the summer.</p>\n<p>Training plans for running are a dime a dozen. After searching for one intended to help improve a 5k race time, <a href=\"https://www.verywellfit.com/5k-intermediate-run-training-2911620\">I found this one at Verywell Fit</a>, which felt <em>right</em>, for me, like something I could apply to my current situation with some ease.</p>\n<p>I say <em>apply</em> because I had no intention of following any plan to the letter, instead choosing to freely adjust it to meet my needs. I dropped the plan back to 4 runs a week rather than 5; up to that point I was still generally running only 3 times a week, and jumping to 5 felt like a bad idea. I&rsquo;ve been interested in trying to get an extra run in during the week, though, so it felt like 4 runs a week was a comfortable stretch I was ready to try to make.</p>\n<p>I kept what I thought of as the three core runs‚Äîthe interval run (or, &ldquo;the one with lots of extremely short, stupidly fast runs&rdquo;), the tempo run (or, &ldquo;the one with the mid-length, maintainably swift run&rdquo;), and the long, slow run (or, &ldquo;the one with the I-feel-like-I-could-literally-do-this-forever run&rdquo;)‚Äîbecause I wanted to formally experiment with speed while also consciously slowing down my long run.</p>\n<p>A little back story on that last point: leading up to the 10k in May I realized that I was kind of just going out and doing the same run all the time, generally going fast-for-me every time, and while I was getting faster, it also felt unsustainable. I wasn&rsquo;t playing with all the keys on the piano. Reading around online I kept seeing the same refrain about how most of your training run time should really be lighter, slower, more at a conversational pace. So even before I started the plan I was trying to learn how to slow down more often; with the plan, dedicating a couple runs each week to speed also meant trying my hardest to keep my other runs more low-key, either by pace or heart rate.</p>\n<p>All told, all of this pushed me to broaden my sense of my range as a runner‚Äîwhich, yes, calling myself a &ldquo;runner&rdquo; makes me feel like a huge imposter, still, sure‚Äîto really see what I was capable of at the upper and lower ends of my dials, and to start playing around a bit more with my sense of control and feel. Should I choose to focus on speed, like I plan to do at this race, I have a better sense of what healthy speed feels like and how very bad uh-oh-bad-idea speed can feel, the difference between the pace that can get me through the first two-thirds of the race and the pace I can throw at the last half mile because there&rsquo;s no reason to hold anything back because I will never ever ever have to run ever again for as long as I live as soon as I hit that finish line (at least until I go out again for my next run sometime after the race). Whatever happens at the race, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve bettered my sense of feel.</p>\n<p>As I said above I did introduce a fourth easy run to my week. With interval runs on Tuesday, tempo runs on Thursday, and my long run on Saturday, I put the easy run on Monday, thinking to give myself a rest day after my long run day (and a free night to enjoy an adult beverage or two on Saturdays, after that long run!). This worked for me, there was a nice rhythm to the week, and I&rsquo;m hoping after the race to keep the fourth run going, after a couple super easy recovery weeks. I might move it back to Sundays, to the weekend, because holy moly do the weeks feel <em>full</em> right now, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>\n<p>I liked the rhythm of having at most two runs two days in a row, for me, where I&rsquo;m at now. There was one week where I did have to move my Monday easy run to Wednesday, and while I did it, while I made three days in a row work that one time, and I actually did pretty well on that Thursday tempo run, I think I still prefer the more steady rate of rest days between run days. It definitely caught up to me in the fays that followed. I&rsquo;m not there yet, at least not with those fairly intense runs in the mix.</p>\n<p>I did little cross-training, because time is hard, though I did try to make sure I walked at least one good solid mile every day to help keep things loose, either as a lunchtime break or just around parks trying to keep up with my two kids. It&rsquo;s not much, but it&rsquo;s something. Again, unless the Olympics open up to middle-aged guys who drink beer for fun, what I&rsquo;m doing right now is just fine, thanks.</p>\n<p>I also found a yoga routine that I liked, which occupied Wednesday nights. I&rsquo;m pretty hooked on that now. The one time I skipped that was the one week where I had some pain that tipped from &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an old man and I&rsquo;m naturally creaky and of course I hurt but it&rsquo;s, like, a <em>good</em> hurt&rdquo; over to &ldquo;Oh no, my body is 75 percent broken-down rusty old cars and 25 percent small woodland creatures making their homes inside those cars.&rdquo; That week I had to skip my tempo run and shorten my long run; that little bit of recovery space cleared the way for a strong finish, though, letting me land my first (and last, for a while!) 20+ mile week ever just last week.</p>\n<p>All in all, the training plan itself went pretty well. I liked making the plan and then following it‚Äîdoing 90 percent of the thinking up front, mostly, and then just doing the doing after that. For the most part, at least. I definitely felt free to modify details as I went based on what I learned along the way. I learned a bit about when I&rsquo;m better doing a run by pace instead of heart rate; how to set my watch to give me useful information instead of just constantly screaming at me the whole time that I, a total hobbyist, was unable to consistently keep a completely consistent tempo within a narrow 20 second range; when to go a little harder and when to ease up.</p>\n<p>On the flip side&hellip;putting all this time toward one specific goal that&rsquo;s going to happen in a single half-hour timespan early on a single Saturday evening is a weird headspace to be in. That&rsquo;s the mental game, though. I tell myself that what actually happens at the race doesn&rsquo;t matter‚ÄîI could absolutely flub it and have the worst run of my life, and it wouldn&rsquo;t matter one bit, because the process of getting to that point, the work and improvements I&rsquo;ve enjoyed leading up to the race, that&rsquo;s the part that really matters for me.</p>\n<p>Which is a very nice thing to tell myself! And it might even be true! Still, though, obviously, of course I&rsquo;d be lying if I said that reaching that goal, perhaps even crushing it, reaching one of the <em>secret goals</em> I have locked away inside my brain for fear of ruining them by even thinking of speaking them aloud, doesn&rsquo;t actually matter to me at all. It does. Doing the thing would obviously be the incredibly delightful cherry to drop on top of this sundae. The sundae doesn&rsquo;t really need it, but it sure would look nice, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve got a couple easy runs ahead of me this week, a couple extra rest days, and then it&rsquo;s race day. My hope is that I&rsquo;ve both learned a few things that will help me run a better race than I have in the past, and that I&rsquo;ve also conditioned my system enough so that I comfortably take all my extra race-day adrenaline and pour it all out onto the race course. Whatever happens, it&rsquo;s not going to matter, but also, I feel pretty good about what could happen.</p>\n<p>Once I actually get to do the thing. Can I just do it right now? Get it over with? That&rsquo;d be nice. No? No? Darn. Worth the ask, anyway.</p>\n",

I'm not there yet, at least not with those fairly intense runs in the mix.\n\nI did little cross-training, because time is hard, though I did try to make sure I walked at least one good solid mile every day to help keep things loose, either as a lunchtime break or just around parks trying to keep up with my two kids. It's not much, but it's something. Again, unless the Olympics open up to middle-aged guys who drink beer for fun, what I'm doing right now is just fine, thanks. \n\nI also found a yoga routine that I liked, which occupied Wednesday nights. I'm pretty hooked on that now. The one time I skipped that was the one week where I had some pain that tipped from \"I'm an old man and I'm naturally creaky and of course I hurt but it's, like, a *good* hurt\" over to \"Oh no, my body is 75 percent broken-down rusty old cars and 25 percent small woodland creatures making their homes inside those cars.\" That week I had to skip my tempo run and shorten my long run; that little bit of recovery space cleared the way for a strong finish, though, letting me land my first (and last, for a while!) 20+ mile week ever just last week.\n\nAll in all, the training plan itself went pretty well. I liked making the plan and then following it‚Äîdoing 90 percent of the thinking up front, mostly, and then just doing the doing after that. For the most part, at least. I definitely felt free to modify details as I went based on what I learned along the way. I learned a bit about when I'm better doing a run by pace instead of heart rate; how to set my watch to give me useful information instead of just constantly screaming at me the whole time that I, a total hobbyist, was unable to consistently keep a completely consistent tempo within a narrow 20 second range; when to go a little harder and when to ease up.\n\nOn the flip side...putting all this time toward one specific goal that's going to happen in a single half-hour timespan early on a single Saturday evening is a weird headspace to be in. That's the mental game, though. I tell myself that what actually happens at the race doesn't matter‚ÄîI could absolutely flub it and have the worst run of my life, and it wouldn't matter one bit, because the process of getting to that point, the work and improvements I've enjoyed leading up to the race, that's the part that really matters for me.\n\nWhich is a very nice thing to tell myself! And it might even be true! Still, though, obviously, of course I'd be lying if I said that reaching that goal, perhaps even crushing it, reaching one of the *secret goals* I have locked away inside my brain for fear of ruining them by even thinking of speaking them aloud, doesn't actually matter to me at all. It does. Doing the thing would obviously be the incredibly delightful cherry to drop on top of this sundae. The sundae doesn't really need it, but it sure would look nice, wouldn't it?\n\nI've got a couple easy runs ahead of me this week, a couple extra rest days, and then it's race day. My hope is that I've both learned a few things that will help me run a better race than I have in the past, and that I've also conditioned my system enough so that I comfortably take all my extra race-day adrenaline and pour it all out onto the race course. Whatever happens, it's not going to matter, but also, I feel pretty good about what could happen. \n\nOnce I actually get to do the thing. Can I just do it right now? Get it over with? That'd be nice. No? No? Darn. Worth the ask, anyway.\n",
