I don&rsquo;t know.)</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><em>Nova</em> by Sylvaine</strong>. (By all rights I should have saved the wintry Nordic metal for, I don&rsquo;t know, July. But sometimes you&rsquo;ve gotta steer into the skid.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Versions of Modern Performance</em> by Horsegirl</strong>. (I feel like there&rsquo;s this round of girl-singers-doing-retro-90s-stuff bands going around right now and I&rsquo;m generally here for it.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Star</em> by Belly</strong>. (Hat tip to ‚ÄúWhirring‚Äù by The Joy Formidable for inspiring a big finish at the end of this run.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Ethereality</em> by Pastel Ghost</strong>. (I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the right comparison but I kind of have this in that same sort of warmly chill synthy pop realm as Purity Ring. If I could line up the right bands I could probably easily do a whole chill month&rsquo;s runs to acts like this.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Warmth</em> by Blondes</strong>. (Remaining a sucker for a good weather album title joke. It was <em>not</em> warm out there that night.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Cosmogramma</em> by Flying Lotus</strong>. (Not my favorite album of his, but felt like the right one to try a run to.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Adam &amp; Eve</em> by Catherine Wheel</strong>. (Okay, so, I&rsquo;m a huge Catherine Wheel fan. Top to bottom, their entire discography, love it, love them, love their music. If they ever got back together I would be torn between selling plasma to get front row seats and wanting nothing to do with it because you shouldn&rsquo;t see your heroes get old and grab cash, right? Right. Anyway! This album has been one of the ones that&rsquo;s most grown on me in the last, uh, let&rsquo;s not count how many years I&rsquo;ve been listening to them now? Anyway: it&rsquo;s a shockingly amazing running album. It&rsquo;s basically an album full of upward-lifting swells, one after the other, and I feel like every time I&rsquo;ve listened to it while running, I&rsquo;ve run a little bit quicker, a little bit lighter, I&rsquo;ve just felt a little <em>better</em>. It&rsquo;s picked me up and carried me a bit further with each pass. And&hellip;now I don&rsquo;t get to listen to it during a run again this year. Boo! Bummer! Whose stupid idea was this plan, anyway/ Anyway. Your mileage may vary. And&hellip;yup, I just killed the &ldquo;your mileage may vary&rdquo; joke in the February list, didn&rsquo;t I? Crud. It&rsquo;s going to be a long year.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Purple</em> by Baroness</strong>. (It was a little cruel, popping this one one, for what was intended to be an easy run. It&rsquo;s also probably not the first choice folks have for favorite Baroness album but I don&rsquo;t even care because this album slams so good.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Screen Violence</em> by Chvrches</strong>. (Trying to parcel out their albums over the year. Not sure I&rsquo;m going to do a great job at it.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>A Cricket in Times Square</em> by A Cricket in Times Square</strong>. (A secret classic by a band you&rsquo;ve never heard of. I wish they&rsquo;d stayed together; they should have been huge. That said: this album is amazing.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>13 Tales From Urban Bohemia</em> by The Dandy Warhols</strong>. (Good long run album, actually. A little all over the place!)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Lobes</em> by We Are Scientists</strong>. (Hey, these guys are still around! And they&rsquo;re still fun. Fun! Also of note: I started downshifting pretty hard this week, ahead of race training. I&rsquo;m questioning that choice today.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Memory</em> by Vivian Girls</strong>. (Easily one of my top 10 bands.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Far</em> by Regina Spektor</strong>. (Is it a weird choice for my favorite Regina Spektor album? I don&rsquo;t know. Don&rsquo;t care. It&rsquo;s wonderful.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Melody‚Äôs Echo Chamber</em> by Melody‚Äôs Echo Chamber</strong>. (Psychy dreamy rock pop? Yes please.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Detrimentalist</em> by Venetian Snares</strong>. (I was starting to come down with what would be at least a week-long head cold and this album helped me power through my first official training run of race training this cycle, with a 30 minute tempo run. Then everything fell apart&hellip;)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Total album count&rsquo;s now at 33 albums, assuming I haven&rsquo;t missed anything.

I like all the recurring motifs throughout this album.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Asiatisch</em> by Fatima Al Qadiri</strong>. (While I want to like her music more than I think I actually do, this album did make running through the rain with the lights reflecting off the puddles feel like I was a background character in <em>Bladerunner</em>, and that was pretty great.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>The Inheritors</em> by James Holden</strong>. (I thought this would be more fun to run to than it actually was. It&rsquo;s a great album, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, but I think in retrospect it&rsquo;s maybe a bit too electroproggyskronk to make for good running music.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>All the Time</em> by Jessy Lanza</strong>. (Summer vibes welcome.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Puberty 2</em> by Mitski</strong>. (I wasn&rsquo;t ready to do intervals yet&hellip;but you kind of can&rsquo;t not do a pseudo-interval or two to the chorus of &ldquo;Best American Girl&rdquo;.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Other Truths</em> by Do Make Say Think</strong>. (I mean, when you can pair a four track album that&rsquo;s forty minutes long to a four mile run&hellip;yeah.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Body Talk</em> by Robyn</strong>. (I felt bad about giving this one up so early in the year but I really needed to take some sunshine on my run.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Reachy Prints</em> by Plaid</strong>. (If you ever have the opportunity to go for a four mile run on a cold winter&rsquo;s night when the snow is still clinging to the tree branches and the world looks like the inside of a fractal and you can pair it with music like Plaid&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s worth it.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Time&rsquo;s Arrow</em> by Ladytron</strong>. (I ran a little too hard to this not-very-hard album. In any case, new Ladytron is always welcome.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>Psychic</em> by DARKSIDE</strong>. (Slowed me down, necessarily, nicely, to a neat groove.

(It&rsquo;s kind of amazing it took me this long to think of running to this one. There&rsquo;s a nice three-act structure to the album, somewhat perfectly mirroring the warm-up/steady-stride/please-give-me-a-final-stretch-pick-up-and-carry-me-home structure of, at my paces, a seven mile rune. It was kind of perfect for that.)</li>\n<li><strong><em>The Big Freeze</em> by Laura Stevenson</strong>. (Laura Stevenson is wonderful.

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;m planning on running a full marathon in 2024.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been planning for this since I started training for the half marathon I just ran. I looked at the half marathon as a chance to dip my toe in the distance-running water to see whether I liked the feel for this kind of training or whether it felt like too much. So far, so good: nothing about the half marathon cycle I just went through made me want to give up.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s funny, because even with what I&rsquo;ve done, I still feel like I have a little imposter syndrome, when it comes to running. I still feel very conservative in my approach, using the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; still kind of makes me want to break out in hives, and I come into this knowing that running a full marathon isn&rsquo;t some huge life-long dream of mine. (For that, you&rsquo;d have to look at biking. While I&rsquo;ve biked one metric century, I still feel like I&rsquo;ve got at least one full 100 mile ride in me. Some day.) I started running three years ago in order to support a particular charity 5k, and with two kids in the house I was looking for a form of exercise that was a bit more effective than bicycling (which long rides, when I was training for that metric century, took me out of the house <em>forrrevvvver</em>), and because I generally thought it would be cool to be able to run a full mile without stopping. After a couple rocky years I got more consistent with running last year and started wondering if I could run a marathon.</p>\n<p>And I started to think that maybe I could. And I started to think that maybe if I thought I could, if I even had an inkling of interest in it, maybe I should do something about it sooner rather than later, because while I&rsquo;m not old, I&rsquo;m certainly not getting any younger. At one point I thought about just going straight for it in 2023 but then decided I&rsquo;m just not that hardcore. So I came up with a loose plan to give myself well over a year to build up to it while also giving myself plenty of freedom to back out at any time for any reason with no penalty.</p>\n<p>And now here I am, my first half marathon in the books, and as of right now, that big-picture goal still seems reasonable. I mean, it seems crazy, but also possible. Nothing about this process the last few months made me want to quit. Whether or not I actually make it all the way I feel like I&rsquo;m having fun right now, like I&rsquo;m building up a sustainable running practice, and I&rsquo;m learning a lot about what motivates me to keep going, and of which is worth it.</p>\n<p>And I can still run <em>one whole mile</em> without stopping. And that still does feel pretty cool!</p>\n<p>That said, I&rsquo;ve learned a bit about how goal motivated I am. Races‚Äîas much as I anguish over them‚Äîbring structure and focus to all the runs that come before them. So I&rsquo;m going to keep doing them, and I&rsquo;m planning on doing two more half-marathons in 2023. I want to re-run the Fall Classic in November, because I want to have at least one year-over-year apples-to-apples comparison, just to see what there is to see. Before that I want to try for a late spring race, I think, because I&rsquo;d like to run at least one of these races in (hopefully) nice weather. I&rsquo;ve earned that!</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m also ready to care about pace a little more. Admittedly, I ran the November race slow enough that it would be tough <em>not</em> to beat that time next time out, after another round of training, but also I just <em>know</em> I can go faster than that, and I want to specifically try for that. I never expect to be competitive at these things, nor am I interested in trying hard enough to be. But I also know it&rsquo;s fun to surprise yourself, and I can get behind trying hard enough for that. So I&rsquo;m setting out with the loose goal this spring of beating my first time, and then going for something reasonably ambitious in the fall.</p>\n<p>To that end, in the short term, I want to run more during the next training cycle. Not necessarily harder, but more. I know I trained at about the barest possible minimal level for the fall race. Next time out I want to go from three days a week to four. I think I&rsquo;m going to repeat the same basic 12-week training calendar as the last time out, which I liked the general feel of, with the addition of the fourth day, which would be a shorter, light/easy day. I have no plans to target five days as I want to keep a day or two free for an elliptical session or finding a strength training or yoga habit I like.</p>\n<p>While I said I don&rsquo;t necessarily want to run harder, I do generally want to bring my paces up across the board. Sometimes these last few months I felt fine, sometimes I felt like I had more to give but was holding back. I&rsquo;m still not quite sure what easy <em>should</em> actually feel like but I think just in general the more I run the more efficient I get and if I can maintain my consistency through into the new year I&rsquo;ll naturally feel a little more okay going a little more fast a little more often. Maybe more importantly though, for confidence purposes, I want to push my race pace experiments more aggressively. I want to pick an ambitious target early and stick with it the whole way through. I really wasn&rsquo;t sure what felt right this last time through, and now I think I want to use those runs to push myself to give a little more. Still, even if it&rsquo;s nothing like what I run on race day, having those faster days in the training cycle feels fun.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m also hoping to do some shorter races that I can really try for my best-possible paces. I&rsquo;m thinking about re-doing the 10k I ran last spring, which left me feeling like I had something unresolved there that I&rsquo;d like to make good on. I&rsquo;m also curious to see if I can beat my summer 5k race&rsquo;s time from last year, too. Which actually feels like it could be the most ambitious goal of the year! If I find some 10k races that fit in with the half marathon plans, I might try to slide those in, too, for practice purposes, but I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s going to work out or not.</p>\n<p>So that&rsquo;s the year in a nutshell, as I picture it right now: a half, some shorter stuff, and then a give-it-my-all half by the year&rsquo;s end.

				"title": "Week twelve running report ... race week! üèÉ",
				"content_html": "<p>Monday afternoon, about 24 hours after I crossed the finish line, is when I finally started to believe that I&rsquo;d just run my first half marathon. I felt pretty spaced out before that, like I&rsquo;d been walking through a post-race cloud, and it was only when I started to come out of it that I felt like I could not just know I did it as a fact but feel that I did it as a truth. If that makes sense. Like I could feel the nervous energy start to dissipate into a sense of accomplishment. It made for a nice post-race high.</p>\n<p>That said: oh my lord, I have never before felt <em>cold</em> like I did right after that race.</p>\n<p>To back up a bit: the week before the race I continued my taper. It got a little weird! I&rsquo;d planned on Tuesday/Thursday runs like usual with super-easy Monday/Friday elliptical sessions, all basically just to keep loose while resting up. Monday went fine, then Tuesday fell apart for various reasons, including truly miserable weather, and I wound up cancelling. So then I went back out for a handful of miles Wednesday night, a few at &ldquo;race pace,&rdquo; then had to turn around and get up early on Friday to get one more run in before work and the weekend. It all worked out fine, and my fears of over-sleeping Friday came to nothing, but the whole stutter-step of a final week&rsquo;s schedule was <em>slightly</em> nerve-wracking.</p>\n<p>I felt good Friday, and slept like a baby that night, which was nice, because I knew I&rsquo;d probably <em>not</em> sleep like a baby the night before the race. (Spoiler alert: I did not sleep good Saturday night.) Saturday felt like one of the longest days of my life. I&rsquo;m learning just how susceptible I am to pre-race nerves. I know it&rsquo;s healthy to a degree, the body&rsquo;s way of getting amped up for the coming event. But I also think I was tipping a bit past &ldquo;excitement&rdquo; and more into &ldquo;bro, you <em>must chill</em>&rdquo; territory. I did not enjoy myself much that day. Again, everything worked out! But I know I want to work out a better day-before strategy for the future.</p>\n<p>Leading up to race day I was watching the weather forecast. Specifically, I was watching the forecasted temperature drop like a rock. Signing up for a late November race in northeast Ohio, I have some idea what I&rsquo;m getting myself into. But! Yikes! Based on my experience at the 5k at the same event last year, I was happily anticipating low-40s, gray clouds, maybe some fog. You know&hellip;perfect running weather. I was not prepared for the low 20s. With a wind chill that took it down to single-digit territory.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How cold was it,&rdquo; you ask? Could enough that I&rsquo;d never adequately had the chance to test race day gear‚ÄîI&rsquo;d run in three layers of clothing earlier that week, but decided at the last minute to throw on a fourth vest layer on top on my running fleece layer. Cold enough that every time I thought I was warmed up enough during the run that I could unzip those top two layers to vent, I was zipping back up within minutes. Cold enough that the water they were giving out on the course was actually freezing‚Äîat least, there were definitely ice chips in mine. Cold enough that a friend of mine said her water pack vest froze up on her, so she couldn&rsquo;t use it during the race. Like, this was not fun running cold. This was <em>real</em> cold. Did I need to score those extra bad-ass points my first time out? No. Did I, though? I guess so!</p>\n<p>The good news is the snow that hit near my house up by the lake was a non-issue to the south, and we got some beautiful (if heatless) sun for the entirety of the race, too. Good for keeping spirits up, at least. And yet, still, it was <em>cold</em> cold.</p>\n<p>As for how I did: I did it. If you&rsquo;ve been following along you know my one goal going into the run was to run the whole way and&hellip;I did that. I ran the whole way. I took full advantage of my &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about pace this time out&rdquo; mindset. My pace was way at the slowest end of my anticipated range, but I still came in just ahead of my &ldquo;Something probably went wrong&rdquo; time. I&rsquo;ll take it! I definitely went very conservative on pacing, as thoughts of burning out early were strong. And of course the weather this fall was way too kind, affording no appropriate lead-in down to race-day temperatures.</p>\n<p>All that said, there really were some nice stretches in the middle where the miles did kind of melt into each other. Five through eight, maybe? Things did get uglier as I went on, though. While I knew for a fact I could do it, I still felt like I had to dig in a bit to convince myself that I was <em>going</em> to do it. That it was going to be <em>way</em> more fun to be able to tell everyone afterward that I did in fact make it. That working for the hard thing, and then achieving it, was exactly the kind of example I wanted to set for my two kids. That if I stopped running, it was going to be a real cold walk back to the finish line&hellip;</p>\n<p>The course was nice‚Äîan out-and-back double-loop along the Cleveland Metroparks parkway drive. Quiet; I did in fact run without music, to prove to myself I could, and without getting into future plans yet, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m going to feel the need to do that again!

				"content_text": "Monday afternoon, about 24 hours after I crossed the finish line, is when I finally started to believe that I'd just run my first half marathon. I felt pretty spaced out before that, like I'd been walking through a post-race cloud, and it was only when I started to come out of it that I felt like I could not just know I did it as a fact but feel that I did it as a truth. If that makes sense. Like I could feel the nervous energy start to dissipate into a sense of accomplishment. It made for a nice post-race high.\n\nThat said: oh my lord, I have never before felt *cold* like I did right after that race.\n\nTo back up a bit: the week before the race I continued my taper. It got a little weird! I'd planned on Tuesday/Thursday runs like usual with super-easy Monday/Friday elliptical sessions, all basically just to keep loose while resting up. Monday went fine, then Tuesday fell apart for various reasons, including truly miserable weather, and I wound up cancelling. So then I went back out for a handful of miles Wednesday night, a few at \"race pace,\" then had to turn around and get up early on Friday to get one more run in before work and the weekend. It all worked out fine, and my fears of over-sleeping Friday came to nothing, but the whole stutter-step of a final week's schedule was *slightly* nerve-wracking.\n\nI felt good Friday, and slept like a baby that night, which was nice, because I knew I'd probably *not* sleep like a baby the night before the race. (Spoiler alert: I did not sleep good Saturday night.) Saturday felt like one of the longest days of my life. I'm learning just how susceptible I am to pre-race nerves. I know it's healthy to a degree, the body's way of getting amped up for the coming event. But I also think I was tipping a bit past \"excitement\" and more into \"bro, you *must chill*\" territory. I did not enjoy myself much that day. Again, everything worked out! But I know I want to work out a better day-before strategy for the future.\n\nLeading up to race day I was watching the weather forecast. Specifically, I was watching the forecasted temperature drop like a rock. Signing up for a late November race in northeast Ohio, I have some idea what I'm getting myself into. But! Yikes! Based on my experience at the 5k at the same event last year, I was happily anticipating low-40s, gray clouds, maybe some fog. You know...perfect running weather. I was not prepared for the low 20s. With a wind chill that took it down to single-digit territory.\n\n\"How cold was it,\" you ask? Could enough that I'd never adequately had the chance to test race day gear‚ÄîI'd run in three layers of clothing earlier that week, but decided at the last minute to throw on a fourth vest layer on top on my running fleece layer. Cold enough that every time I thought I was warmed up enough during the run that I could unzip those top two layers to vent, I was zipping back up within minutes. Cold enough that the water they were giving out on the course was actually freezing‚Äîat least, there were definitely ice chips in mine. Cold enough that a friend of mine said her water pack vest froze up on her, so she couldn't use it during the race. Like, this was not fun running cold. This was *real* cold. Did I need to score those extra bad-ass points my first time out? No. Did I, though? I guess so!\n\nThe good news is the snow that hit near my house up by the lake was a non-issue to the south, and we got some beautiful (if heatless) sun for the entirety of the race, too. Good for keeping spirits up, at least. And yet, still, it was *cold* cold. \n\nAs for how I did: I did it. If you've been following along you know my one goal going into the run was to run the whole way and...I did that. I ran the whole way. I took full advantage of my \"I don't care about pace this time out\" mindset. My pace was way at the slowest end of my anticipated range, but I still came in just ahead of my \"Something probably went wrong\" time. I'll take it! I definitely went very conservative on pacing, as thoughts of burning out early were strong. And of course the weather this fall was way too kind, affording no appropriate lead-in down to race-day temperatures.\n\nAll that said, there really were some nice stretches in the middle where the miles did kind of melt into each other. Five through eight, maybe? Things did get uglier as I went on, though. While I knew for a fact I could do it, I still felt like I had to dig in a bit to convince myself that I was *going* to do it. That it was going to be *way* more fun to be able to tell everyone afterward that I did in fact make it. That working for the hard thing, and then achieving it, was exactly the kind of example I wanted to set for my two kids. That if I stopped running, it was going to be a real cold walk back to the finish line...\n\nThe course was nice‚Äîan out-and-back double-loop along the Cleveland Metroparks parkway drive. Quiet; I did in fact run without music, to prove to myself I could, and without getting into future plans yet, I'm not sure I'm going to feel the need to do that again! Not much in the way of spectators, of course, because of the weather and because of where the course was run. It was fun to see all the fast people running back the other way several times over from my back-of-the-pack vantage point. Huge props to all the volunteers along the course. Every kind word was incredible.\n\nCrossing the finish line, which I finally actually really believed I was going to do once I finally caught sight of it, wasn't exactly anti-climactic, but it also wasn't really accompanied by an orchestral swell, either‚Äîthat feeling, as I said above, really didn't come until 24 hours later. Crossing the finish line mostly meant *oh my god wow I can stop running now*. Which felt really nice for a while. Until the cold settled in. Which I knew to anticipate, but, like, I couldn't *really* anticipate what standing in freezing temperatures in four sweaty layers was actually going to feel like.

				"content_html": "<p>Taper week! Ran four easy miles on Tuesday, four miles on Thursday with two of those at race pace, and five miles on Saturday, my shortest long run since week two. If I was bemoaning the lack of seasonably appropriate training weather the last few weeks, well, Saturday&rsquo;s run threw a big bucket of cold drizzly slushy nonsense right in my face. Felt good to have at least one proper day for testing out possible race day clothing, I suppose?</p>\n<p>I knew going into the week I was ready for this taper time, and while I don&rsquo;t have anything extremely specific to point at to confirm this, I can say I do feel like I&rsquo;m&hellip;actively recharging. Like I can now not just know but also <em>feel</em> the fact that I&rsquo;ve made real gains the last few months. If running week ten&rsquo;s total of 22.5 miles was a stretch and a challenge, one I felt proud to meet, running this week&rsquo;s total of 13 miles left me feeling like my body knew it had more to give. And I&rsquo;m both nervous and excited about tapping into that feeling this coming weekend. (How unfair is it, by the way, that it&rsquo;s when you have the most nervous energy, that you least get to do the thing that helps you vent that energy?)</p>\n<p>All of which&hellip;brings us to this coming Sunday. My goal for the race remains as clear as it has been since the start‚Äîget to the finish line without walking breaks. I know for a fact now that I can make it twelve miles‚Äîwhen I&rsquo;m pretty well under-rested, at that!‚Äîand I think I can reasonably trust that a mix of adrenaline and pure stubbornness will get me past the last 1.1 miles. I&rsquo;m feeling generally confident about this.</p>\n<p>The strategy to get to that point feels like it&rsquo;s all about how I start the race. That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve got some mental baggage I need to shed: the first time I did a 5k and the one time I&rsquo;ve done a 10k, adrenaline and nerves pushed me out too hot, which killed me later in the run. I started training for this race assuming there&rsquo;s a good chance I&rsquo;d make similar mistakes&hellip;but now that I&rsquo;ve gotten to this point, I really, obviously don&rsquo;t want to! So I&rsquo;m hoping to learn from my past and to manage my nerves as I wait for the start, and to keep things real conservative and chill for as long as feels right. I&rsquo;ve been trying to listen to my body during my long runs, and I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out when and how to ease up before reaching that red-line zone, without needing to come to a stop. If I feel good toward the middle of the race I know I can loosen up a bit more, and I hope there&rsquo;s a point toward the end when I can stop holding back and just <em>go</em>, because that sounds like it would be really, really fun&hellip;but to get to those points I need to avoid frying myself too early.</p>\n<p>Part of all this is reminding myself that I don&rsquo;t have a time goal this time out. I have a general idea where I &ldquo;should&rdquo; fall but I&rsquo;m choosing not to make that my concern this time. In large part because, well&hellip;like, this whole process has been an education and a trial, and as part of that, pace has been generally mysterious to me, anyways. Like: Saturday&rsquo;s miles <em>felt</em> easy, but turned out to be a bit on the quick side of my recent range, but not quite at the race pace I&rsquo;ve been practicing at (without any real intent of actually meeting on race day!). It felt really good; does it feel like the kind of easy-fast I can keep for a half-marathon? No idea! At this point I can happily admit I&rsquo;ve never had a good sense these last few months of what my pace zones should feel like. Whatever does happen Sunday I know I&rsquo;ve made obvious gains that I think I can have fun playing around with going forward.</p>\n<p>Which, yes, I have a lot of thoughts already about the <em>going forward</em> part. Which I am trying hard to keep on a shelf for the moment. Because for now I&rsquo;ve got a couple more taper runs to get through and then <a href=\"https://www.clewestrunningclub.org/fall-classic.html#/\">it&rsquo;s time to go do the thing</a>. (Okay, maybe I can go ahead and visualize going forward, a little bit&hellip;specifically, going forward from the finish line to the beer garden?&hellip;)</p>\n",
				"content_text": "Taper week! Ran four easy miles on Tuesday, four miles on Thursday with two of those at race pace, and five miles on Saturday, my shortest long run since week two. If I was bemoaning the lack of seasonably appropriate training weather the last few weeks, well, Saturday's run threw a big bucket of cold drizzly slushy nonsense right in my face. Felt good to have at least one proper day for testing out possible race day clothing, I suppose?\r\n\r\nI knew going into the week I was ready for this taper time, and while I don't have anything extremely specific to point at to confirm this, I can say I do feel like I'm...actively recharging. Like I can now not just know but also *feel* the fact that I've made real gains the last few months. If running week ten's total of 22.5 miles was a stretch and a challenge, one I felt proud to meet, running this week's total of 13 miles left me feeling like my body knew it had more to give. And I'm both nervous and excited about tapping into that feeling this coming weekend. (How unfair is it, by the way, that it's when you have the most nervous energy, that you least get to do the thing that helps you vent that energy?)\r\n\r\nAll of which...brings us to this coming Sunday. My goal for the race remains as clear as it has been since the start‚Äîget to the finish line without walking breaks. I know for a fact now that I can make it twelve miles‚Äîwhen I'm pretty well under-rested, at that!‚Äîand I think I can reasonably trust that a mix of adrenaline and pure stubbornness will get me past the last 1.1 miles. I'm feeling generally confident about this.\r\n\r\nThe strategy to get to that point feels like it's all about how I start the race. That's where I've got some mental baggage I need to shed: the first time I did a 5k and the one time I've done a 10k, adrenaline and nerves pushed me out too hot, which killed me later in the run. I started training for this race assuming there's a good chance I'd make similar mistakes...but now that I've gotten to this point, I really, obviously don't want to! So I'm hoping to learn from my past and to manage my nerves as I wait for the start, and to keep things real conservative and chill for as long as feels right. I've been trying to listen to my body during my long runs, and I've been trying to figure out when and how to ease up before reaching that red-line zone, without needing to come to a stop. If I feel good toward the middle of the race I know I can loosen up a bit more, and I hope there's a point toward the end when I can stop holding back and just *go*, because that sounds like it would be really, really fun...but to get to those points I need to avoid frying myself too early.\r\n\r\nPart of all this is reminding myself that I don't have a time goal this time out. I have a general idea where I \"should\" fall but I'm choosing not to make that my concern this time. In large part because, well...like, this whole process has been an education and a trial, and as part of that, pace has been generally mysterious to me, anyways. Like: Saturday's miles *felt* easy, but turned out to be a bit on the quick side of my recent range, but not quite at the race pace I've been practicing at (without any real intent of actually meeting on race day!). It felt really good; does it feel like the kind of easy-fast I can keep for a half-marathon? No idea! At this point I can happily admit I've never had a good sense these last few months of what my pace zones should feel like. Whatever does happen Sunday I know I've made obvious gains that I think I can have fun playing around with going forward.\r\n\r\nWhich, yes, I have a lot of thoughts already about the *going forward* part. Which I am trying hard to keep on a shelf for the moment. Because for now I've got a couple more taper runs to get through and then [it's time to go do the thing](https://www.clewestrunningclub.org/fall-classic.html#/). (Okay, maybe I can go ahead and visualize going forward, a little bit...specifically, going forward from the finish line to the beer garden?...)\n",

There‚Äôs minor things, weird things I‚Äôm maybe not getting into much, in the interest of keeping these updates somewhat brief, or maybe because I‚Äôm doing a bad job of writing down as much as I actually should. But‚Ä¶while I would never describe this process as <em>easy</em>, I‚Äòm also really surprised‚Äîand, of course, pleased‚Äîat how generally smooth things have been going.</p>\n<p>Case in point: after the slightly weird, mildly narratively interesting week that was week eight, week nine felt‚Ä¶pretty fine! Essentially uneventful! Except of course not exactly uneventful because I ran 20 miles this week for the second time ever, which is certainly an <em>event</em>. But it also kind of just happened, which is nice.</p>\n<p>Five of those miles came from my easy run on Tuesday, which became an unintentional race pace kind of run for a bit, because I kind of just felt good and the weather kind of just felt perfect and I kind of just went faster than I meant to. It did not suck.</p>\n<p>Another five miles came from my actual race pace run on Thursday. In an effort to avoid the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go <em>extra</em> sort of fast for the last stretch‚Äù thing I‚Äôve been doing the last few weeks, I set my watch to just notify me when the three race pace miles were done, rather than notifying me at each mile. That helped, I think. I mean, it made the race pace segment feel very long, but it stayed pretty steady, which felt nice.</p>\n<p>And then of course ten miles came on Saturday morning, which had me out the door before sunrise. I kept the route generally more flat than the previous time I went out for ten miles. It felt long, but it also felt pretty good; certainly better than the week previous. I definitely felt like I needed to push myself to finish, a bit, near the end‚Äîten miles really is so many miles! I think it showed up in my pace graph; my first three miles were on my slower side, but then my last three miles were pretty fast, the last two actually edging into my hypothetical race pace range. All in, where my last three long runs all hit the exact same average pace, this one landed the average at exactly two seconds faster. I‚Äôll take it!</p>\n<p>I know, intuitively, that running can be as much a mental game as a physical one. That said, it has long been hard to imagine ever reaching the point where a run could get long enough to become kind of boring. While I‚Äôm not exactly there yet, I feel like I can see that territory around me, now, on some of these runs. I‚Äôm starting to consciously play with that a bit.</p>\n<p>So like, for this long run, instead of having my watch buzz me after every mile, I had it buzz me after every 2.5 miles, to see what it feels like when I thought of the run less as being a collection of ten miles and more as four longer segments. I‚Äôm not sure how much of a difference it made, until near the end, when that last segment started, and it felt like, somewhat irrationally, it was going to be <em>so much longer than all the others</em>.</p>\n<p>More dramatically, I also took this long run without music. Though I run with music all the time‚Äîa subject worth its own post‚ÄîI‚Äôll leave the headphones behind on race day. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm worried anyone‚Äôs going to think I‚Äôm tempo matching or anything‚ÄîI‚Äôm clearly too slow for that to even matter! It‚Äôs more out of, in part, wanting to keep my situational awareness levels up, as I never run with others around me, and also, in part, because letting in spectator noise, picking up that energy, feels really cool; in the shorter races I‚Äôve done, it‚Äôs a huge part of what‚Äôs made the actual race feel like a real thing. Still, thirteen (point one!) miles is a long time to run without one of my primary crutches, and I wanted to take at least one test run ahead of time without music to make sure I actually could do it. Confirmed: I can actually do it! At least, I can for ten miles. I‚Äôll have to trust race day adrenaline will keep me going for the last three, though, because I‚Äôm definitely soundtracking next week‚Äôs twelve miler. It‚Äôs just way more fun that way.</p>\n<p>Three more weeks to go.</p>\n",

But it also kind of just happened, which is nice. \n\nFive of those miles came from my easy run on Tuesday, which became an unintentional race pace kind of run for a bit, because I kind of just felt good and the weather kind of just felt perfect and I kind of just went faster than I meant to. It did not suck.\n\nAnother five miles came from my actual race pace run on Thursday. In an effort to avoid the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go *extra* sort of fast for the last stretch‚Äù thing I‚Äôve been doing the last few weeks, I set my watch to just notify me when the three race pace miles were done, rather than notifying me at each mile. That helped, I think. I mean, it made the race pace segment feel very long, but it stayed pretty steady, which felt nice.\n\nAnd then of course ten miles came on Saturday morning, which had me out the door before sunrise. I kept the route generally more flat than the previous time I went out for ten miles. It felt long, but it also felt pretty good; certainly better than the week previous. I definitely felt like I needed to push myself to finish, a bit, near the end‚Äîten miles really is so many miles! I think it showed up in my pace graph; my first three miles were on my slower side, but then my last three miles were pretty fast, the last two actually edging into my hypothetical race pace range. All in, where my last three long runs all hit the exact same average pace, this one landed the average at exactly two seconds faster. I‚Äôll take it!\n\nI know, intuitively, that running can be as much a mental game as a physical one. That said, it has long been hard to imagine ever reaching the point where a run could get long enough to become kind of boring. While I‚Äôm not exactly there yet, I feel like I can see that territory around me, now, on some of these runs. I‚Äôm starting to consciously play with that a bit. \n\nSo like, for this long run, instead of having my watch buzz me after every mile, I had it buzz me after every 2.5 miles, to see what it feels like when I thought of the run less as being a collection of ten miles and more as four longer segments. I‚Äôm not sure how much of a difference it made, until near the end, when that last segment started, and it felt like, somewhat irrationally, it was going to be *so much longer than all the others*.\n\nMore dramatically, I also took this long run without music. Though I run with music all the time‚Äîa subject worth its own post‚ÄîI‚Äôll leave the headphones behind on race day. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm worried anyone‚Äôs going to think I‚Äôm tempo matching or anything‚ÄîI‚Äôm clearly too slow for that to even matter! It‚Äôs more out of, in part, wanting to keep my situational awareness levels up, as I never run with others around me, and also, in part, because letting in spectator noise, picking up that energy, feels really cool; in the shorter races I‚Äôve done, it‚Äôs a huge part of what‚Äôs made the actual race feel like a real thing. Still, thirteen (point one!) miles is a long time to run without one of my primary crutches, and I wanted to take at least one test run ahead of time without music to make sure I actually could do it. Confirmed: I can actually do it! At least, I can for ten miles. I‚Äôll have to trust race day adrenaline will keep me going for the last three, though, because I‚Äôm definitely soundtracking next week‚Äôs twelve miler. It‚Äôs just way more fun that way.\n\nThree more weeks to go.\n",

No big deal. (Basically. I actually went maybe one notch harder than I probably should have.

I successfully kept the race pace slower by about 30 seconds for the first two miles (before I kicked it up a bit for the last half mile, because why not) from where I&rsquo;d been the week before, when I&rsquo;d felt I&rsquo;d been going a bit too hard for something sustainable. This felt really good. This felt like the fun kind of tempo run/threshold run/&ldquo;this feels like a good workout&rdquo; run I remember from 5k training in the summer. Faster, for me, without feeling like I was punishing myself. It&rsquo;s a really fun run to include in the weekly mix. (I <em>kind of</em> miss interval running, but I <em>definitely</em> missed these tempo runs.) Still probably not a realistic pace for the whole race, but maybe something I could reach for on the back third, when the final puddle of adrenaline has nowhere else to go?</p>\n<p>And then there&rsquo;s this week&rsquo;s huge milestone: my first 10 mile run.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I tried to spin this into a coherent narrative, but really I just have lots of random thoughts and observations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I made it! Wow!</li>\n<li>It&rsquo;s not to say that my first nine and my first eight mile runs weren‚Äôt huge milestones, but something about crossing over into double-digit territory feels significant.</li>\n<li>Wildly&hellip;ten felt easier than nine. There&rsquo;s a lot of reasons why that could be. I‚Äôve been adding a mile to the long run each week for seven straight weeks now, and maybe finally my body was just like, ‚ÄúOh, okay, yup, this is what we do, now.&quot; Maybe there was a little extra adrenaline kick from going to ten. Maybe it was the route, or the time of day, or the breeze hit just right, or something I ate. Maybe I actually stayed in bed and dreamed the whole run? I don&rsquo;t know. I am not complaining.</li>\n<li>I am decidedly <em>not</em> a morning person. I do most of my running at night or in the afternoon, partially because of life scheduling and partially because <em>I am decidedly not a morning person</em>. Because of scheduling I had to get up for this one at 5:30 AM, though, like some kind of &ldquo;real&rdquo; runner. I was nervous about that, both about actually responding to the alarm that early and then about my body actually <em>doing</em> the thing, which I&rsquo;ve historically had some issues with. But clearly everything worked out.</li>\n<li>I ran ten miles. <em>Ten miles</em>.</li>\n<li>The ascending pace graph wasn&rsquo;t as picture-perfect as the nine miler from the week before, but it was still very, very pretty, and when you average it out to 2.5 mile splits, it looked even nicer. I like this because it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;m explicitly trying for, and it&rsquo;s nice to feel like my body is kind of doing something &ldquo;right&rdquo; without me having to force it. It felt natural, I guess.</li>\n<li>I explored a lot of options for the route, then just wound up&hellip;going. Which was fun. My city&rsquo;s about 6-ish square miles of city blocks, and I live pretty close to smack dab in the center of it, and it turns out it&rsquo;s pretty easy to wind up and down and around to get the miles in without too much planning, so long as you&rsquo;re vaguely aware of how far from home you&rsquo;ve gotten. (I like trying to know about where I&rsquo;m going to end a run; visualizing a finish line keeps me going.)</li>\n<li>I wound up doing a lot of north-south back-and-forth, which is fun, because when you go south, away from the lake, you can get <em>a bit</em> of an upward climb, and then when you head back north, you can get <em>a bit</em> of a descent. Not much! Not even close to much! Ohio&rsquo;s pretty flat around where I&rsquo;m at. But literally any climbing is more climbing than no climbing. Just having that little bit of variance in the route helps keep things interesting. All told I think it added up to about three times more &ldquo;climbing&rdquo; than the half-marathon route will entail. I probably actually need to consciously make sure my long runs are more flat just to make sure that&rsquo;s not a big factor come race day.</li>\n<li>Did I mention the part where I ran for <em>ten miles</em>?</li>\n<li>Up to this run I&rsquo;ve generally felt okay about this project‚Äîlike the half-marathon goal is possible, but still kind of a huge abstraction, something I&rsquo;m working toward, but who knows if I&rsquo;ll actually make it. With this run I finally felt like, yeah, okay: I&rsquo;ve got this. Not that I&rsquo;m going to get cocky or anything, there&rsquo;s still a lot miles between me and the finish line, but I actually definitely mostly sort of kind of feel like I&rsquo;m probably certainly maybe going to make it. Potentially! Which is a cool feeling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This coming week brings a relative breather‚Äîmy two weekday runs both go up by half a mile but my weekend run drops back to eight, the first time my weekend run goes shorter since I began the training plan. (&ldquo;Shorter&rdquo; in this case meaning &ldquo;will qualify as one of my four longest runs ever to date.&quot;) So I lose a mile this week but then the following two weeks pack on multiple extra miles ahead of the taper week. Those two weeks will probably put my whole good-vibes feeling to the test, I suspect.</p>\n",

Still probably not a realistic pace for the whole race, but maybe something I could reach for on the back third, when the final puddle of adrenaline has nowhere else to go?\n\nAnd then there's this week's huge milestone: my first 10 mile run. \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2022/ec42cc7510.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"A map showing the route of a ten mile run.\" />\n\nI tried to spin this into a coherent narrative, but really I just have lots of random thoughts and observations:\n\n- I made it! Wow!\n- It's not to say that my first nine and my first eight mile runs weren‚Äôt huge milestones, but something about crossing over into double-digit territory feels significant. \n- Wildly...ten felt easier than nine. There's a lot of reasons why that could be. I‚Äôve been adding a mile to the long run each week for seven straight weeks now, and maybe finally my body was just like, ‚ÄúOh, okay, yup, this is what we do, now.\" Maybe there was a little extra adrenaline kick from going to ten. Maybe it was the route, or the time of day, or the breeze hit just right, or something I ate. Maybe I actually stayed in bed and dreamed the whole run? I don't know. I am not complaining.\n- I am decidedly *not* a morning person. I do most of my running at night or in the afternoon, partially because of life scheduling and partially because *I am decidedly not a morning person*. Because of scheduling I had to get up for this one at 5:30 AM, though, like some kind of \"real\" runner. I was nervous about that, both about actually responding to the alarm that early and then about my body actually *doing* the thing, which I've historically had some issues with. But clearly everything worked out.\n- I ran ten miles. *Ten miles*.\n- The ascending pace graph wasn't as picture-perfect as the nine miler from the week before, but it was still very, very pretty, and when you average it out to 2.5 mile splits, it looked even nicer. I like this because it's not something I'm explicitly trying for, and it's nice to feel like my body is kind of doing something \"right\" without me having to force it. It felt natural, I guess.\n- I explored a lot of options for the route, then just wound up...going. Which was fun. My city's about 6-ish square miles of city blocks, and I live pretty close to smack dab in the center of it, and it turns out it's pretty easy to wind up and down and around to get the miles in without too much planning, so long as you're vaguely aware of how far from home you've gotten. (I like trying to know about where I'm going to end a run; visualizing a finish line keeps me going.)\n- I wound up doing a lot of north-south back-and-forth, which is fun, because when you go south, away from the lake, you can get *a bit* of an upward climb, and then when you head back north, you can get *a bit* of a descent. Not much! Not even close to much! Ohio's pretty flat around where I'm at. But literally any climbing is more climbing than no climbing. Just having that little bit of variance in the route helps keep things interesting. All told I think it added up to about three times more \"climbing\" than the half-marathon route will entail. I probably actually need to consciously make sure my long runs are more flat just to make sure that's not a big factor come race day.\n- Did I mention the part where I ran for *ten miles*?\n- Up to this run I've generally felt okay about this project‚Äîlike the half-marathon goal is possible, but still kind of a huge abstraction, something I'm working toward, but who knows if I'll actually make it. With this run I finally felt like, yeah, okay: I've got this. Not that I'm going to get cocky or anything, there's still a lot miles between me and the finish line, but I actually definitely mostly sort of kind of feel like I'm probably certainly maybe going to make it. Potentially! Which is a cool feeling.\n\nThis coming week brings a relative breather‚Äîmy two weekday runs both go up by half a mile but my weekend run drops back to eight, the first time my weekend run goes shorter since I began the training plan. (\"Shorter\" in this case meaning \"will qualify as one of my four longest runs ever to date.\") So I lose a mile this week but then the following two weeks pack on multiple extra miles ahead of the taper week. Those two weeks will probably put my whole good-vibes feeling to the test, I suspect.\n",

For as weirdly anxious as I was going into the run, my pace felt good, generally in the lower half of my original minute target range; I slowed down a bit around mile six, which, coincidentally, I&rsquo;m sure, was the one part of the run with something resembling actual climb. Then I finished strong. My last mile was my fastest.

It felt good to open back up some for the first time since the 5k; it was nice to feel like I hadn&rsquo;t completely lost all the gains I made during that training period.

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve had two nights with the PlayStation 5. Not coincidentally, I&rsquo;ve also recently had two utterly and completely blown bedtimes. And I have thoughts!</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve heard about the adaptive triggers on the new controllers for a while now but I had no idea what any of it meant until I actually I booted up the <em>Astro&rsquo;s Playroom</em> demo game and actually <em>felt</em> them kick in. It&rsquo;s maybe weird to admit this, but it felt like a bit of a jaw-drop moment. I didn&rsquo;t really know that controllers themselves could still be developed in new and interesting ways. I don&rsquo;t know how <em>much</em> there is to be done with this, maybe it&rsquo;s just a weird gimmick, but it feels like a gimmick I would very much miss were it to stop being a thing.</p>\n<p>I took the <em>Demon&rsquo;s Souls</em> remake for a brief spin, just through the intro tutorial and a tiny bit into wandering around the nexus. I played the heck out of the original back in the day and I&rsquo;m sure I have an incredibly nostalgic view of how good that game looked on the PS3. I imagine if I loaded it up today, it would still look <em>good</em>, I mean it would feel more like a modern game than anything on a PS1 would feel, but it couldn&rsquo;t look or feel as good as I remember it being. The PS5 remake, though&hellip;<em>it looks like my memory of the original</em>. It&rsquo;s somehow more real than my rose-tinted memory. It made me feel like I was having the kind of disorienting, out-of-time experience that could probably only be represented by an incredibly specific 23 syllable German word. I&rsquo;m looking forward to spending at least a little more time there.</p>\n<p>From there I wanted to try something new and exclusive so I&rsquo;m taking <em>Returnal</em> for a spin. I&rsquo;ve been dipping back into <em>Dead Cells</em> again recently on my iPad so this sort of rogue-like system has been top of mind lately‚Äîit&rsquo;s kind of theoretically perfect for how I play games these days, anyways. Also, <em>Returnal</em> comes from Housemarque, which was responsible for <em>Resogun</em>, probably one of my top ten favorite games ever. So, I mean, it&rsquo;s an instant gotta-try game. I&rsquo;m telling myself I&rsquo;m not going to get locked into any one game out of the gate here, as I don&rsquo;t have much game-playing time at my disposal, and I want to sample broadly to see what&rsquo;s what out there, but darn it if after my first couple cycles through the game if I&rsquo;m not completely hooked on the story, the setting, the look, and the overall feel. It is so absurdly smooth; I&rsquo;m not prone to motion sickness in games, but oh, sometimes, jumping off a ledge, I can&rsquo;t help but kind of feel my inner ear start to tell me that <em>hey that ground sure is coming up at you real hard and fast right now</em>.</p>\n<p>Still, between these two games there&rsquo;s definitely a sense of&hellip;like I said, the PS3 is closer to a PS5 than a PS1 is to a PS3; this feels like a more powerful iteration of something familiar, not a completely new thing entirely. But&hellip;what a compelling iteration it is.

				"content_text": "I've had two nights with the PlayStation 5. Not coincidentally, I've also recently had two utterly and completely blown bedtimes. And I have thoughts!\n\nI've heard about the adaptive triggers on the new controllers for a while now but I had no idea what any of it meant until I actually I booted up the *Astro's Playroom* demo game and actually *felt* them kick in. It's maybe weird to admit this, but it felt like a bit of a jaw-drop moment. I didn't really know that controllers themselves could still be developed in new and interesting ways. I don't know how *much* there is to be done with this, maybe it's just a weird gimmick, but it feels like a gimmick I would very much miss were it to stop being a thing.\n\nI took the *Demon's Souls* remake for a brief spin, just through the intro tutorial and a tiny bit into wandering around the nexus. I played the heck out of the original back in the day and I'm sure I have an incredibly nostalgic view of how good that game looked on the PS3. I imagine if I loaded it up today, it would still look *good*, I mean it would feel more like a modern game than anything on a PS1 would feel, but it couldn't look or feel as good as I remember it being. The PS5 remake, though...*it looks like my memory of the original*. It's somehow more real than my rose-tinted memory. It made me feel like I was having the kind of disorienting, out-of-time experience that could probably only be represented by an incredibly specific 23 syllable German word. I'm looking forward to spending at least a little more time there.\n\nFrom there I wanted to try something new and exclusive so I'm taking *Returnal* for a spin. I've been dipping back into *Dead Cells* again recently on my iPad so this sort of rogue-like system has been top of mind lately‚Äîit's kind of theoretically perfect for how I play games these days, anyways. Also, *Returnal* comes from Housemarque, which was responsible for *Resogun*, probably one of my top ten favorite games ever. So, I mean, it's an instant gotta-try game. I'm telling myself I'm not going to get locked into any one game out of the gate here, as I don't have much game-playing time at my disposal, and I want to sample broadly to see what's what out there, but darn it if after my first couple cycles through the game if I'm not completely hooked on the story, the setting, the look, and the overall feel. It is so absurdly smooth; I'm not prone to motion sickness in games, but oh, sometimes, jumping off a ledge, I can't help but kind of feel my inner ear start to tell me that *hey that ground sure is coming up at you real hard and fast right now*. \n\nStill, between these two games there's definitely a sense of...like I said, the PS3 is closer to a PS5 than a PS1 is to a PS3; this feels like a more powerful iteration of something familiar, not a completely new thing entirely. But...what a compelling iteration it is. I love the Nintendo Switch and I love the games I'm playing on that with my two boys; I mean, *Breath of the Wild* is so far beyond the hype its silly. I definitely have a few other gaming itches though that I think the PS5 is going to scratch.\n\nOne dumb complaint, though: the system interface feels crazy. Maybe they just nailed it with the PS4 interface, but I feel like I'm still trying to wrap my head around what's available when and what these different hidden layers are and...yeah. I'll get used to it, I don't hate it, and maybe it'll get better if I learn what I can (and should) turn off, but right now it feels like just a bit too much.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about trying a half marathon‚Äîand, yes, a full marathon‚Äîfor a while now. Now, I&rsquo;m actually planning on going after my first half marathon at the <a href=\"https://www.clewestrunningclub.org/fall-classic.html\">Fall Classic</a> in Cleveland on November 22.</p>\n<p>Why now? I&rsquo;ve been running for three years now, pretty consistently for the last year, and I still like it, I want to keep doing it, and I think I&rsquo;m in a good position to go for it. Coming off the 5k in July I know that having a challenge like that in front of me helps put the day-to-day activity into a framework that helps me keep my interest levels up. Also, I&rsquo;m 44, and while I know I&rsquo;ve got plenty of potential running years ahead of me should I choose to accept them, I also know I&rsquo;m not getting any younger, so if I&rsquo;ve got even a flicker of interest in it, now&rsquo;s probably the time to go for it.</p>\n<p>I will also say that my goals here are all very soft. I know well that anything from cataclysmic injury to flagging interest in the face of the demanding commitment could derail the whole process and that&rsquo;s fine. If I make it, I want it to feel incredible, and if I don&rsquo;t, I want to remember that I&rsquo;m still running and have run more miles in this lifetime than I may ever have expected I would.</p>\n<p>All that said, my ultimate goal, of course, is to tackle a full marathon. I&rsquo;ve been toying with some plans for a bit now and I think my best bet is start off with a half marathon in November, another in May 2023, and a third in November 2023, before moving on to the full marathon in May 2024. Assuming I&rsquo;m still healthy! And happy! And that there&rsquo;s still land to run on that hasn&rsquo;t been covered by the sea. I think this gives me the chance to build up my confidence and experiment with training approaches and intensities, while still pacing things out in a way so that it stays fun. I don&rsquo;t need to rush it and make myself miserable, but I don&rsquo;t want the big goal to be total vaporware.</p>\n<p>For this first half marathon, my only goal right now is to run the whole thing without needing walking breaks. I don&rsquo;t want to set a firm time goal, though I&rsquo;m <em>guessing</em> I could land it somewhere between 2:15 and 2:30, if I can maintain a healthy pace for the duration. That said, I took walking breaks during my first 5k in 2019, and during my first 10k earlier this year, and even if I&rsquo;m running like a dream in the weeks leading up to the half marathon, I know there&rsquo;s a swell chance race-day nerves will kick in and I&rsquo;ll wind up coming out hot and I&rsquo;ll need to compensate later. Which will be perfectly fine‚Äîall the more reason for giving myself at least three attempts at the half distance before going on to full as I work on figuring out how to tame that tendency.</p>\n<p>For my training schedule, I&rsquo;m going somewhat softly this first time, more softly in some ways than I did for the 5k in July. I&rsquo;m taking a hybrid of <a href=\"https://www.verywellfit.com/half-marathon-training-schedule-for-beginners-2911618\">this beginner&rsquo;s plan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.verywellfit.com/advanced-beginner-half-marathon-training-schedule-2911617\">this advanced beginer&rsquo;s plan</a>. I&rsquo;m taking the slightly more aggressive cadence of the advanced beginner&rsquo;s plan for the Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday runs, but I&rsquo;m swapping out the Sunday easy run in favor of cross-training, as suggested by the beginner&rsquo;s plan.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m going with the higher-mileage plan just because because I feel like I can do it, and that those few extra miles each week will help me feel more confident going into the race. Generally the miles will be easier miles than I did training for the 5k‚Äîlike, no hard interval runs, this time out, and my &ldquo;race pace&rdquo; runs I <em>think</em> will be less intense than my threshhold runs from the 5k training plan. Mostly I want to continue educating my body about what my &ldquo;next gear&rdquo; feels like, to try to get some better sense of what sustainable and potential trouble each feel like. Honestly, pace in general is a huge question mark for me, right now, which is all the more reason to treat this first attempt as an educational experiment.</p>\n<p>As for the extra cross-training day on Sundays, while I was running four days a week training for the 5k, while I&rsquo;m really excited to know I can do that, I kind of want to keep that in reserve for next time. If this first round goes well, introducing the fourth day again next time should be an easy way to help me improve from there. I do also wonder if it was maybe a shade too much, what with including hard intervals and fairly hard threshhold runs in the mix. I&rsquo;m still working my confidence back up after the mild knee injury I developed during the race and I&rsquo;m not looking to aggravate that just yet. So aside from just, you know, taking it easy on my joints, I&rsquo;ve also started getting out on my bicycles again, which has felt really nice, and I&rsquo;m happy to use cross-training as an excuse to keep putting some easy miles in on the wheels.</p>\n<p>All that said, I can&rsquo;t lie‚ÄîI&rsquo;m certainly already second-guessing myself, here. Was it a mistake to tell everyone so early that I&rsquo;m trying this? Is it a mistakle to try this at all? Is this actually already happening, is this real, am I really doing my first official training runs this week? I guess there&rsquo;s only one way to answer these questions.</p>\n",

I&rsquo;ve been running for about 3 years at this point, though I didn&rsquo;t get really consistent with it until about last September, after completely bottoming out last summer. Coming out of this stretch of consistency, I was concerned about the summer‚ÄîI did so well during the winter, would I lose all my progress when the summer heat hit? Having a formal short-term goal on top of a real training plan felt like a good way to keep my motivation and momentum up.</p>\n<p>So, I set the goal of not just making it to the 5k, but PRing at it&hellip;even if only by one second. Up to this point I&rsquo;ve mostly tried to look at speed and pace as interesting but not important. I&rsquo;m too old to need to go fast. My goals this year have been more around consistency and racking up a certain number of miles over the course of the year. But, given how I&rsquo;ve felt lately and the level consistency I&rsquo;ve maintained, speed has felt like something interesting I could play with. I&rsquo;ve felt like I <em>could</em> consciously boost my pace a bit, even if only for one race. So I decided to go for it, knowing once the race is behind me I can happily revert to easier runs to ride out the rest of the summer.</p>\n<p>Training plans for running are a dime a dozen. After searching for one intended to help improve a 5k race time, <a href=\"https://www.verywellfit.com/5k-intermediate-run-training-2911620\">I found this one at Verywell Fit</a>, which felt <em>right</em>, for me, like something I could apply to my current situation with some ease.</p>\n<p>I say <em>apply</em> because I had no intention of following any plan to the letter, instead choosing to freely adjust it to meet my needs. I dropped the plan back to 4 runs a week rather than 5; up to that point I was still generally running only 3 times a week, and jumping to 5 felt like a bad idea. I&rsquo;ve been interested in trying to get an extra run in during the week, though, so it felt like 4 runs a week was a comfortable stretch I was ready to try to make.</p>\n<p>I kept what I thought of as the three core runs‚Äîthe interval run (or, &ldquo;the one with lots of extremely short, stupidly fast runs&rdquo;), the tempo run (or, &ldquo;the one with the mid-length, maintainably swift run&rdquo;), and the long, slow run (or, &ldquo;the one with the I-feel-like-I-could-literally-do-this-forever run&rdquo;)‚Äîbecause I wanted to formally experiment with speed while also consciously slowing down my long run.</p>\n<p>A little back story on that last point: leading up to the 10k in May I realized that I was kind of just going out and doing the same run all the time, generally going fast-for-me every time, and while I was getting faster, it also felt unsustainable. I wasn&rsquo;t playing with all the keys on the piano. Reading around online I kept seeing the same refrain about how most of your training run time should really be lighter, slower, more at a conversational pace. So even before I started the plan I was trying to learn how to slow down more often; with the plan, dedicating a couple runs each week to speed also meant trying my hardest to keep my other runs more low-key, either by pace or heart rate.</p>\n<p>All told, all of this pushed me to broaden my sense of my range as a runner‚Äîwhich, yes, calling myself a &ldquo;runner&rdquo; makes me feel like a huge imposter, still, sure‚Äîto really see what I was capable of at the upper and lower ends of my dials, and to start playing around a bit more with my sense of control and feel. Should I choose to focus on speed, like I plan to do at this race, I have a better sense of what healthy speed feels like and how very bad uh-oh-bad-idea speed can feel, the difference between the pace that can get me through the first two-thirds of the race and the pace I can throw at the last half mile because there&rsquo;s no reason to hold anything back because I will never ever ever have to run ever again for as long as I live as soon as I hit that finish line (at least until I go out again for my next run sometime after the race). Whatever happens at the race, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve bettered my sense of feel.</p>\n<p>As I said above I did introduce a fourth easy run to my week. With interval runs on Tuesday, tempo runs on Thursday, and my long run on Saturday, I put the easy run on Monday, thinking to give myself a rest day after my long run day (and a free night to enjoy an adult beverage or two on Saturdays, after that long run!). This worked for me, there was a nice rhythm to the week, and I&rsquo;m hoping after the race to keep the fourth run going, after a couple super easy recovery weeks. I might move it back to Sundays, to the weekend, because holy moly do the weeks feel <em>full</em> right now, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>\n<p>I liked the rhythm of having at most two runs two days in a row, for me, where I&rsquo;m at now. There was one week where I did have to move my Monday easy run to Wednesday, and while I did it, while I made three days in a row work that one time, and I actually did pretty well on that Thursday tempo run, I think I still prefer the more steady rate of rest days between run days. It definitely caught up to me in the fays that followed. I&rsquo;m not there yet, at least not with those fairly intense runs in the mix.</p>\n<p>I did little cross-training, because time is hard, though I did try to make sure I walked at least one good solid mile every day to help keep things loose, either as a lunchtime break or just around parks trying to keep up with my two kids. It&rsquo;s not much, but it&rsquo;s something. Again, unless the Olympics open up to middle-aged guys who drink beer for fun, what I&rsquo;m doing right now is just fine, thanks.</p>\n<p>I also found a yoga routine that I liked, which occupied Wednesday nights. I&rsquo;m pretty hooked on that now. The one time I skipped that was the one week where I had some pain that tipped from &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an old man and I&rsquo;m naturally creaky and of course I hurt but it&rsquo;s, like, a <em>good</em> hurt&rdquo; over to &ldquo;Oh no, my body is 75 percent broken-down rusty old cars and 25 percent small woodland creatures making their homes inside those cars.&rdquo; That week I had to skip my tempo run and shorten my long run; that little bit of recovery space cleared the way for a strong finish, though, letting me land my first (and last, for a while!) 20+ mile week ever just last week.</p>\n<p>All in all, the training plan itself went pretty well. I liked making the plan and then following it‚Äîdoing 90 percent of the thinking up front, mostly, and then just doing the doing after that. For the most part, at least. I definitely felt free to modify details as I went based on what I learned along the way. I learned a bit about when I&rsquo;m better doing a run by pace instead of heart rate; how to set my watch to give me useful information instead of just constantly screaming at me the whole time that I, a total hobbyist, was unable to consistently keep a completely consistent tempo within a narrow 20 second range; when to go a little harder and when to ease up.</p>\n<p>On the flip side&hellip;putting all this time toward one specific goal that&rsquo;s going to happen in a single half-hour timespan early on a single Saturday evening is a weird headspace to be in. That&rsquo;s the mental game, though. I tell myself that what actually happens at the race doesn&rsquo;t matter‚ÄîI could absolutely flub it and have the worst run of my life, and it wouldn&rsquo;t matter one bit, because the process of getting to that point, the work and improvements I&rsquo;ve enjoyed leading up to the race, that&rsquo;s the part that really matters for me.</p>\n<p>Which is a very nice thing to tell myself! And it might even be true! Still, though, obviously, of course I&rsquo;d be lying if I said that reaching that goal, perhaps even crushing it, reaching one of the <em>secret goals</em> I have locked away inside my brain for fear of ruining them by even thinking of speaking them aloud, doesn&rsquo;t actually matter to me at all. It does. Doing the thing would obviously be the incredibly delightful cherry to drop on top of this sundae. The sundae doesn&rsquo;t really need it, but it sure would look nice, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve got a couple easy runs ahead of me this week, a couple extra rest days, and then it&rsquo;s race day. My hope is that I&rsquo;ve both learned a few things that will help me run a better race than I have in the past, and that I&rsquo;ve also conditioned my system enough so that I comfortably take all my extra race-day adrenaline and pour it all out onto the race course. Whatever happens, it&rsquo;s not going to matter, but also, I feel pretty good about what could happen.</p>\n<p>Once I actually get to do the thing. Can I just do it right now? Get it over with? That&rsquo;d be nice. No? No? Darn. Worth the ask, anyway.</p>\n",
