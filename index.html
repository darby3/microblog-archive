		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I started running in 2019 in order to do the <a href="https://runsignup.com/Race/OH/Cleveland/StrollRoll5K1MileFunRun">MetroHealth Friends of Mothers &amp; Infants Stroll &amp; Roll 5K</a>. The race supports a great cause, and in just a few months, it forced me to go from ‚ÄúRunning a full mile would be kind of a neat thing to do!‚Äù to ‚ÄúWow, I just ran three miles! Nobody in the history of the world has ever done that before! I am <em>amazing</em>!‚Äù</p>
<p>And then I kept running.</p>
<p>Kind of.</p>
<p>Looking back, I realize my consistency those first two years was very hit or miss. I&rsquo;m not surprised that it culminated in a full-scale break-down blow-out &ldquo;This is stupid! I quit! And&hellip;and‚Ä¶did I mention this is stupid?&rdquo; moment last summer. There were other factors at play, sure, but also, it was stupid and running was stupid and I quit.</p>
<p>Turns out, sometimes quitting is smart. I needed to walk away from my running-induced frustrations for a while. After clearing my head, I realized running wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> stupid. And that I wasn&rsquo;t ready to quit.</p>
<p>So I started back up September with a nice easy 1 mile run.</p>
<p>And <em>then</em> I kept running.</p>
<p>Not every specific run has been fun, obviously, but running itself has been fun in general. I&rsquo;m not setting world records, I&rsquo;m not looking to compete against others. But my confidence and enjoyment have both increased.</p>
<p>Races have helped. I did the Stroll &amp; Roll again in the fall, and then I ran a chilly 5k at the <a href="https://www.clewestrunningclub.org/fall-classic.html">Cleveland Fall Classic</a>, and then in the spring I achieved the personal bucket list item of doing a 5k in under 30 minutes at the <a href="https://runsignup.com/Race/OH/Cleveland/TreatYoSelf">Treat Yo Self 5k</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out, consistency is good. Who knew! Doing the thing means you can do the thing! And I‚Äôm pretty sure I have gotten better at doing the thing, too. Now, I think, from a certain angle, if you squint at the last nine months <em>just</em> right, I think you can safely say that I‚Äôve gone from ‚Äúvery slow but well-meaning‚Äù to ‚Äúkind of actually approaching something resembling thoroughly average‚Äù.</p>
<p>Progress!</p>
<p>Most recently I ran the 10k the weekend of the <a href="https://www.clevelandmarathon.com/">Cleveland Marathon</a>, where I didn&rsquo;t do as well as I&rsquo;d hoped I would, and am totally and completely fine with that. What mattered to me more was just doing it at all, getting the experience of it, the education from it, and also oh yeah surprising myself with some really great runs leading up to the race.</p>
<p>And, just, I mean&hellip;I did the thing! It&rsquo;s possible I wore my finisher medal around the house for about a week afterward! Ask my family how much fun and totally not insufferable I am!</p>
<p>Next up, I&rsquo;m running the <a href="https://runsignup.com/Race/OH/Lakewood/SummerMeltdown5K">Lakewood Summer Meltdown 5k</a>. This race happens in shouting distance of my house and I&rsquo;ve wanted to do it since I started running. Since even before that: being a bystander at the party in the preceding years, seeing people crossing the finish line, feeling the energy in the air around it all, I think that contributed a lot to me even <em>thinking</em> about starting running.</p>
<p>After I finished the 10k in May I realized I had exactly 8 weeks until the Meltdown 5k. It felt like a good time to experiment with my running schedule and explore different kinds of runs, with the goal of getting my speed up, even just a quarter-notch or so, in order to try to set a new 5k PR at the race. Lo and behold, I found <a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/5k-intermediate-run-training-2911620">a training plan that catered exactly to that</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about halfway through this 8 week session. I think it&rsquo;s been going well! I stepped that plan back slightly at the outset‚Äîbefore this I was only running 3 days a week; and 5 felt like it would have been too much of a jump, especially for an old man like me, but 4 felt like a nice, attainable stretch goal, a limit I could get behind pushing. So I&rsquo;m following the interval run, tempo run, and long run routine, with an extra easy run mixed in there.</p>
<p>This has smoothly but also dramatically pushed my weekly mileage up each week from where I was around the time of the 10k. It&rsquo;s also varied the kinds of miles I&rsquo;m running, which has been educational. Consciously doing &ldquo;easier&rdquo; miles has felt weird, even for someone who doesn&rsquo;t really go all that fast when he&rsquo;s going his fastest, but getting a broader sense of my range, a greater feel for what I can do (run 0.25 mile sprint at a sub-7:30 pace!) and can‚Äôt do (run a 0.25 mile sprint at a sub-7:30 pace if I‚Äôm going to do more than a few of those sprints in a single session!) has been interesting. It&rsquo;s fun to know what my hardest-run interval feels like, compared to those easy-breezy I-could-do-this-forever slow-boat long-run miles. Also turns out I absolutely love whatever passes for my version of a tempo run. Cool! That probably means I‚Äôm doing it wrong! Bummer!</p>
<p>As for my race goal, if I can shave just one second off my last 5k race time, this will be a total and complete personal victory. And if I don‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt. But I think I can. So I‚Äôm going to go for it.</p>
<p>After that, I‚Äôm pondering where I‚Äôm going to go from here. There‚Äôs a lot of options, now, which is kind of a wild place to be.</p>
