			 <p>Okay! Week six! The build continues, with a nine mile run following last week‚Äôs eight miler. And it went swimmingly: without really trying, I managed to create the most beautiful pace graph ever, with every mile either at or a bit above the pace of the previous mile, right on through to the end. Even past the point around the start of mile seven when I started having mild doubts about whether or not I was even going to make it to the end. Cardiovascularly I was feeling pretty good, and my energy level was okay, though I was definitely <em>feeling</em> it‚Äîthe basic endurance required to just keep going for that long is truly something else‚Ä¶but oh gosh did my legs feel like I was trying to run nine miles for the first time a week after running eight miles for the first time. Not horrible, but not exactly strain-free, either! It‚Äôs possible there was some internal motivational screaming happening during mile eight. It‚Äôs possible there was some <em>audible</em> motivational screaming happening in mile nine. Possibly! Maybe! It‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm fine and definitely not crazy or weird.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre at the point here near Cleveland where the temperature is starting to drop, which makes me start thinking really hard about <em>hey wait how the heck do I dress for these conditions again</em>? I‚Äôve been through enough of these cycles now that I‚Äôm going into this fall season knowing well that I just run hot, in general, doubly so when I‚Äôm actually running, and that whatever other people might be wearing, I‚Äôm going to be better off wearing <em>less</em> than what my rational mind tells me to wear. For today‚Äôs low-fifties-and-overcast run, that meant skipping the extra layers I was starting to think I should start thinking about piling on. Though I did upgrade from a thin running shirt to a merino running shirt! Short sleeves, though! Felt good, and once I warmed up a bit, it took stronger gusts to remind me that, hey, it was actually kind of chilly out there. But yeah, it‚Äôs probably time to think about pulling out the extra stuff.</p>
<p>The easy four miler on Monday was‚Ä¶an easy four miles. I ran a weird route because I‚Äôve got this side thing going where I‚Äôm trying to run so that my heat map on Strava eventually indicates that I‚Äôve run every single street in Lakewood. Picked up a couple streets that I‚Äôd somehow skipped over to date. It‚Äôs a silly project but a fun way to force me to mix up my routes a bit, now and then. (There‚Äôs going to be some really weird runs in my future dedicated to logging time on weird little tiny side streets.)</p>
<p>My pace race run on Wednesday, I was up to two miles of race pace running, for which I‚Äôd slid my target pace another thirty seconds faster from the week previous, and I landed both miles pretty close to the fastest end of that minute. And‚Ä¶yeah, I think it‚Äôs time to try to figure out how to consciously slide my pace back into the slower half of that minute. I think what I‚Äôm looking for is a pace where it feels like I‚Äôm running fast but not hard; the race pace portion of Wednesday‚Äôs run was fast, for me, but probably a bit too hard, for a sustainable long-distance effort. Or at least, I don‚Äôt feel compelled to try to maintain that pace for that long, not yet, not at this stage. I‚Äôm just not quite sure that I know how to fine-tune my pace to such a degree, yet, though I guess actually consciously trying to will be a good start!</p>
<p>Which all brings me to the exact halfway point of this half-marathon training plan. At least in terms of weeks‚Äîthere‚Äôs a <em>lot</em> of miles to cover yet! Right now, today, eight hours after I finished my long run, I‚Äôm feeling pretty good about all this. I feel like, so long as I can keep my motivation up, I‚Äôm still on track to make it to that half-marathon finish line in something resembling one piece. Knock on wood, fingers crossed, all that good stuff‚Ä¶.</p>

			 <p>Throwing a couple bookmarklet code samples up here for reference.</p>
<p>These stemmed from <a href="https://micro.blog/amit/13460628">this conversation thread</a> which finally got me thinking about a couple super simple bookmarklets I could add for my own convenience. Add these as bookmarks to the browser toolbar, and click them as needed to filter out posts. They&rsquo;re not feature-rich, they&rsquo;re one-way only (i.e., to un-hide posts, you need to refresh the page!), and they&rsquo;re only tested (barely) in Firefox, so anyone else&rsquo;s mileage may vary.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a JS bookmarklet for hiding MB posts from the <a href="https://micro.blog">https://micro.blog</a> timeline based on length. The &ldquo;25&rdquo; in the middle is a character count‚Äîthat can be manually fine-tuned by changing the number, to hide various lengths of posts. Because sometimes there&rsquo;s lots of tiny short posts that fill up the timeline, and this is a way to quickly hide them, for convenience.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>javascript: (() =&gt; { document.querySelectorAll('.post').forEach(post =&gt; {   const text = post.querySelector('.post_text');   if (text.innerText.length &lt; 25 ) {     post.style.display = &quot;none&quot;;   } })})()
</code></pre><p>Here&rsquo;s a JS bookmarklet for hiding MB @ mention posts from the the <a href="https://micro.blog">https://micro.blog</a> timeline. It&rsquo;s just looking for an &lsquo;@&rsquo; at the start of the post, and if it finds it, it hides the post. Because sometimes you want to see mentions because they lead to interesting conversations you wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise discovered, and other times you just want to filter them out so you can see top-level posts by themselves.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>javascript: (() =&gt; { document.querySelectorAll('.post').forEach(post =&gt; {      const text = post.querySelector('.post_text');   if (text.innerText[0] === '@' ) {     post.style.display = &quot;none&quot;;   } })})()

			 <p>For my second race pace run, this Wednesday, I‚Äôd set my target pace range minute 30 seconds faster than the prior week‚Äôs target, based on the earlier week&rsquo;s pace. Then I did the first mile 15 seconds faster than that. And the following half mile at a 45 seconds faster pace. Which felt amazing but also <em>whaaaaat</em>? I don&rsquo;t know. Either my body is telling me something my mind doesn&rsquo;t know what to do with, or my mind hasn&rsquo;t clearly communicated the <em>real</em> plan to my body yet. So I&rsquo;m kind of torn. I could try to let it rip like this for as long as I can, because after all, I clearly have no idea what my pace ranges actually are or should be, and seeing how far I can push these paces is definitely educational. On the flip side I could try to reign it back in, and try harder to target something closer to my easy run paces‚Äîfaster, still, but not <em>that</em> much faster, so I gain a better sense of what an ambitious, but also realistic, pace feels like. I think I&rsquo;m going to just roll with it for another week before trying to course-correct just yet. If nothing else, it does feel really good to have this kind of fast-for-me run in the mix.</p>
<p>Did my long run on Friday. 8 miles. My new longest run ever! Felt good! Felt long! Can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m going to turn back around and go 9 miles this coming week! For as weirdly anxious as I was going into the run, my pace felt good, generally in the lower half of my original minute target range; I slowed down a bit around mile six, which, coincidentally, I&rsquo;m sure, was the one part of the run with something resembling actual climb. Then I finished strong. My last mile was my fastest. Whatever is happening on race pace days, I&rsquo;d be one hundred percent happy with running the half marathon the way I&rsquo;m running these weekend long runs, if it means successfully running the whole way without bonking out or redlining mid-race.</p>
<p>Worth noting, I&rsquo;m generally trying to be conscious of how I feel <em>between</em> the runs, as one way of gauging how I&rsquo;m doing, and so far everything has felt, as best as I can tell, within reasonable bounds of expectation. I only felt a little rickety, this Saturday, is what I&rsquo;m saying. As a relatively old man doing his first half-marathon training I&rsquo;ll take &ldquo;a little rickety&rdquo; any day!</p>
<p>Monday&rsquo;s easy four miler? It rained. Hard. I was drenched within a minute of walking out the door. It was fine enough once I got going, and then it actually mostly stopped raining for the middle portion of the run. Then the rain returned with a vengeance for the final mile. it&rsquo;s been a week and I may actually still be soaked through from that run. I may never be dry again. Honestly the novelty of running in weather that probably made me look like an absolute crazy person was kind of worth it, it was certainly an interesting thing to do, but here&rsquo;s to hoping I don&rsquo;t have to make a habit out of it.</p>
<p>The other interesting thing about this week was that I&rsquo;d had to pull all these runs forward a day due to weekend scheduling conflicts. I can clearly say I did fine‚ÄîI did it!‚Äîbut also I felt sort of like could feel that missing extra full rest day, a bit. Not by much, and it felt good to know I could push through that, but there was maybe an extra notch of <em>ugh</em> on the old fatigue meter this week. I wasn&rsquo;t upset when I hit the weekend and had something resembling a full downtime day on Sunday.</p>
<p>I also haven&rsquo;t mentioned cross-training efforts here yet, I think, mostly because they&rsquo;re not interesting, but I&rsquo;m generally keeping up with them, which is nice; if nothing else, increasing my activity level across the week is a plus. It&rsquo;s typically been either an elliptical session or a bike ride, neither too strenous, just enough to loosen up. Mostly it&rsquo;s been the elliptical, as the weather has started turning. (As much as biking is my first love, it sure is easier to run in the cold than to bike.) I&rsquo;ve hit every middle-of-the-week session so far, with weekends being a bit spottier, based on general life happenings. So, like, this past Saturday I couldn&rsquo;t do anything formal, but after walking around Michigan parks for over 11,000 steps with my family, I think I can say: I&rsquo;m good!</p>
<p>Final bonus fun fact: I listened to the <a href="https://fujiyamiyagi.bandcamp.com/album/slight-variations">new Fujiya &amp; Miyagi album</a> for the first time during my long run. They&rsquo;re great. The album is great. Hearing David Best sing the line &ldquo;We&rsquo;re closer to the end than we are the beginning&rdquo; as I was literally crossing the four-mile midpoint of the run? Truly cosmic.</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôd flagged this week as the start of my build phase, but now I think it was maybe my last ‚Äúgimme‚Äù week‚Äîthere wasn&rsquo;t anything in the plan I haven&rsquo;t done before and it was mostly a question of doing it <em>now</em> as proof that I could be ready in time for what comes next. So I guess I&rsquo;ll call it a transition week?</p>
<p>My long run on Saturday was seven miles. I&rsquo;ve done seven before, a handful of times, and I felt comfortable taking it on this time, even keeping an average pace a notch faster than last week‚Äôs six miler. The weather didn&rsquo;t hurt‚Äîpicture-perfect for running, overcast, low 60s, some breeze. In the past every time I&rsquo;ve hit this kind of distance I think I&rsquo;ve started to realize just how much the long run game is a mental one as it is a physical one. Running at a comfortable pace means feeling like I could, theoretically, physically do it forever; convincing myself, mentally, over and over again, that that is actually a good idea, a valid use of my time, <em>and</em> the actual goal is&hellip;weird. Realizing that Saturday&rsquo;s <em>last</em> mile was going to be my <em>middle</em> mile during the half marathon in eight weeks was also quite the rude perspective shift!</p>
<p>Thursday was the first &ldquo;race pace&rdquo; run. A mile warm up, a mile cool down, a race pace mile sandwiched in the middle. (Hold the mayo.) (Yes, I&rsquo;m a dad, have I mentioned that yet?) I&rsquo;d set a minute-long pace range that I wanted to maintain for that middle mile that was meant to feel like a stretch while also giving me plenty of leeway to make it feel right. Turns out what felt right was a pace fifteen seconds <em>faster</em> than my target range. It felt good! It felt good to open back up some for the first time since the 5k; it was nice to feel like I hadn&rsquo;t completely lost all the gains I made during that training period. Now, I really don&rsquo;t believe the pace I ran Thursday was something I could actually maintain for 13 (and an oh and a point and a one-zero) miles; I mean, maybe it is, maybe I&rsquo;m holding myself back, I know I&rsquo;m perpetually concerned about over-doing it. (As my wife has put it, &ldquo;Darby is very aware of his limits.&quot;) I don&rsquo;t know. Either way, I do like those fast-but-not-absurd runs, and I&rsquo;ve missed them since finishing the 5k training. Having that variety in the week is fun, a little spicy. I think I can safely slide my original target pace range forward by about 30 seconds. We&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>
<p>Tuesday night&rsquo;s easy run continued the trend out of the previous week of my easy pace naturally starting to lift; it felt more like the race pace I expected to do on Thursday night (which probably translated to me pushing that mile faster on Thursday). I think I was running off some stress, too. Either way: faster than expected. Not the third-in-a-row ultra-low-heart-rate-Tuesday-run in a row I was on the lookout for, which is fine.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, things definitely actually for-<em>real</em>-real get interesting the next three weeks. I add a mile a week to the long runs each week (three weeks of new longest runs ever!), and a half mile a week to the race pace segment on Thursdays; Tuesdays will lock in at four miles for a while. Plus I&rsquo;m pulling all my runs forward a day for the next two weeks, due to some weekend scheduling conflicts. Fingers crossed, that&rsquo;s not a recipe for disaster.</p>

			 <p>When I was setting up this training plan, I had mentally flagged this week not as a do-or-die week, but maybe as a sort of‚Ä¶do-or-seriously-reassess-my-life-choices week. All three runs were longer this week, taking me up to 14.5 miles; nothing too far outside my comfort zone yet, but it was going to be a big jump over last week‚Äôs 12.</p>
<p>The good news is, this week was‚Ä¶fairly uneventful! I feel like I‚Äôm relaxing into and enjoying the easy runs; my pace has been way below what I know I‚Äôm capable of, and I love it. After doing the speed thing earlier this year, running easy feels so pleasant. If I lost all interest in pushing my boundaries, I think I could happily repeat a week like this one for as long as my body wants to hold up.</p>
<p>The most newsworthy run was my 3.5 mile Tuesday run, which was my second shockingly low heart rate Tuesday run in a row. Either my watch glitched twice in a row, or I‚Äôm figuring out the zone two thing when I‚Äôm at my most well-rested. If I make it three in a row I‚Äôll start to think I‚Äôm actually on to something. The Thursday five miler was smooth sailing; I‚Äôve done pretty well in the heat this year, but yeah, the cooler night temperatures are making me happy. Despite shifting into the warmer afternoon today for six miles, I didn‚Äôt have any trouble getting through it, and even managed to clock my fastest pace for the week. Still slow! Still easy! But I‚Äôd be lying if I said it didn‚Äôt feel good to lop a few seconds off my pace without feeling like I was punishing myself in the process.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to week four, I‚Äôll run less total mileage, but I‚Äôll start introducing ‚Äúrace pace‚Äù runs on Thursdays. My plan for those miles right now (well, mile, this week‚Äîone race pace mile, between a warm up and cool down mile) is just to try to run a little faster than I have been lately; still trying to keep it completely doable, but a notch more intense. I‚Äôm giving myself a lot of latitude to experiment, to see what feels good and maintainable, while also knowing I‚Äôm not actually committing myself to running those paces on race day. I think it will be easier to figure out what I‚Äôm doing with those runs once I get a few behind me.</p>

			 <p>Not a bad week!</p>
<p>The three miler on Tuesday was weird. I knew I wanted to keep it light after the slugfest that was last Saturday, but‚Ä¶the maximum heart rate my watch reported at the end had to be an error. Was I even moving? Pace felt right, though, slow even for a generally slow runner like me, and I really didn‚Äôt feel even the slightest bit winded at the end of it, so‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôd like to try to do that again, whatever it is I did!</p>
<p>Thursday felt more typical. It also felt really good. Pace averaged out down under 11/min which is my current rough (and evolving) target for the half. It just felt like a really good run, like exactly the kind of run I hope to maintain for the half. Too soon to tell if that‚Äôs optimistic or not yet.</p>
<p>Saturday‚Äôs five miler I wound up running much earlier in the day than I usually do which mostly means it felt like I had to work for it a bit more than usual. But it was much smoother than last weekend‚Äôs four miler‚Äînever felt like I had to quit or stop, caught myself a couple times feeling like I was maybe starting to ramp up too much and started figuring out how to deliberately slow down a bit to compensate. (Also a good sign, I didn‚Äôt feel completely wiped out for the very long day of family activities I immediately transitioned to post-run.)</p>
<p>Overall this week felt like what I needed; both further cementing a healthy base and also recovering from the rough run last weekend. Which is the kind of thing that really only comes with the perspective of having been doing a thing for a while‚Äîonce upon a time a crummy run meant I was a total failure and all my progress was lost and also I‚Äôm a huge fraud. Now it‚Äôs more just a bump in the road of a much longer game. Not that I don‚Äôt beat myself up for it, just‚Ä¶not as much.</p>
<p>The next two weeks I‚Äôve felt for a while are going to be‚Ä¶interesting? Bellwethers? Things ramp up this week, all three runs are longer than the previous weeks‚Äô counterparts, with a long 5 miler on Thursday and a 6 miler on Saturday. The following week mileage drops a bit for a bit but only because of the transition to race pace runs on Thursdays. It‚Äôs going to get interesting. And educational.</p>

			 <p>One week into the half marathon training plan. Still feel like I‚Äôm trying to get back into the swing of things, trying to relearn how to actually keep easy runs‚Ä¶easy.</p>
<p>The first two runs were pretty solid. I don‚Äôt think my knee is giving me any real trouble now.</p>
<p>Saturday‚Äôs four miler was one of my uglier runs, though; had to stop once or twice to get my heart rate back down because I could feel myself redlining. It was far warmer outside than I‚Äôd anticipated, which might have been part of the problem.</p>
<p>So that wasn‚Äôt ideal but the good takeaway was that‚Äîin the past when I‚Äôve stopped like that I‚Äôve typically struggled to keep going at all after; this time I did run all the miles. So that was an interesting development.</p>
<p>Also took a new set of shoes out for the first time, switching from my New Balance 860s to the Asics GT-2000s. I‚Äôve been feeling like I‚Äôve been landing hard in the 860s and felt like it was a good time to try something new after 3 years. One I got going I did like the feel of the Asics. We‚Äôll see how they do over the next week.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had two nights with the PlayStation 5. Not coincidentally, I&rsquo;ve also recently had two utterly and completely blown bedtimes. And I have thoughts!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard about the adaptive triggers on the new controllers for a while now but I had no idea what any of it meant until I actually I booted up the <em>Astro&rsquo;s Playroom</em> demo game and actually <em>felt</em> them kick in. It&rsquo;s maybe weird to admit this, but it felt like a bit of a jaw-drop moment. I didn&rsquo;t really know that controllers themselves could still be developed in new and interesting ways. I don&rsquo;t know how <em>much</em> there is to be done with this, maybe it&rsquo;s just a weird gimmick, but it feels like a gimmick I would very much miss were it to stop being a thing.</p>
<p>I took the <em>Demon&rsquo;s Souls</em> remake for a brief spin, just through the intro tutorial and a tiny bit into wandering around the nexus. I played the heck out of the original back in the day and I&rsquo;m sure I have an incredibly nostalgic view of how good that game looked on the PS3. I imagine if I loaded it up today, it would still look <em>good</em>, I mean it would feel more like a modern game than anything on a PS1 would feel, but it couldn&rsquo;t look or feel as good as I remember it being. The PS5 remake, though&hellip;<em>it looks like my memory of the original</em>. It&rsquo;s somehow more real than my rose-tinted memory. It made me feel like I was having the kind of disorienting, out-of-time experience that could probably only be represented by an incredibly specific 23 syllable German word. I&rsquo;m looking forward to spending at least a little more time there.</p>
<p>From there I wanted to try something new and exclusive so I&rsquo;m taking <em>Returnal</em> for a spin. I&rsquo;ve been dipping back into <em>Dead Cells</em> again recently on my iPad so this sort of rogue-like system has been top of mind lately‚Äîit&rsquo;s kind of theoretically perfect for how I play games these days, anyways. Also, <em>Returnal</em> comes from Housemarque, which was responsible for <em>Resogun</em>, probably one of my top ten favorite games ever. So, I mean, it&rsquo;s an instant gotta-try game. I&rsquo;m telling myself I&rsquo;m not going to get locked into any one game out of the gate here, as I don&rsquo;t have much game-playing time at my disposal, and I want to sample broadly to see what&rsquo;s what out there, but darn it if after my first couple cycles through the game if I&rsquo;m not completely hooked on the story, the setting, the look, and the overall feel. It is so absurdly smooth; I&rsquo;m not prone to motion sickness in games, but oh, sometimes, jumping off a ledge, I can&rsquo;t help but kind of feel my inner ear start to tell me that <em>hey that ground sure is coming up at you real hard and fast right now</em>.</p>
<p>Still, between these two games there&rsquo;s definitely a sense of&hellip;like I said, the PS3 is closer to a PS5 than a PS1 is to a PS3; this feels like a more powerful iteration of something familiar, not a completely new thing entirely. But&hellip;what a compelling iteration it is. I love the Nintendo Switch and I love the games I&rsquo;m playing on that with my two boys; I mean, <em>Breath of the Wild</em> is so far beyond the hype its silly. I definitely have a few other gaming itches though that I think the PS5 is going to scratch.</p>
<p>One dumb complaint, though: the system interface feels crazy. Maybe they just nailed it with the PS4 interface, but I feel like I&rsquo;m still trying to wrap my head around what&rsquo;s available when and what these different hidden layers are and&hellip;yeah. I&rsquo;ll get used to it, I don&rsquo;t hate it, and maybe it&rsquo;ll get better if I learn what I can (and should) turn off, but right now it feels like just a bit too much.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://darby3.micro.blog/2022/08/29/190000.html">My (current, highly malleable) half-marathon plan üèÉ</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://darby3.micro.blog/2022/08/29/190000.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-08-29 19:00:00 -0400">Aug 29, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about trying a half marathon‚Äîand, yes, a full marathon‚Äîfor a while now. Now, I&rsquo;m actually planning on going after my first half marathon at the <a href="https://www.clewestrunningclub.org/fall-classic.html">Fall Classic</a> in Cleveland on November 22.</p>
<p>Why now? I&rsquo;ve been running for three years now, pretty consistently for the last year, and I still like it, I want to keep doing it, and I think I&rsquo;m in a good position to go for it. Coming off the 5k in July I know that having a challenge like that in front of me helps put the day-to-day activity into a framework that helps me keep my interest levels up. Also, I&rsquo;m 44, and while I know I&rsquo;ve got plenty of potential running years ahead of me should I choose to accept them, I also know I&rsquo;m not getting any younger, so if I&rsquo;ve got even a flicker of interest in it, now&rsquo;s probably the time to go for it.</p>
<p>I will also say that my goals here are all very soft. I know well that anything from cataclysmic injury to flagging interest in the face of the demanding commitment could derail the whole process and that&rsquo;s fine. If I make it, I want it to feel incredible, and if I don&rsquo;t, I want to remember that I&rsquo;m still running and have run more miles in this lifetime than I may ever have expected I would.</p>
<p>All that said, my ultimate goal, of course, is to tackle a full marathon. I&rsquo;ve been toying with some plans for a bit now and I think my best bet is start off with a half marathon in November, another in May 2023, and a third in November 2023, before moving on to the full marathon in May 2024. Assuming I&rsquo;m still healthy! And happy! And that there&rsquo;s still land to run on that hasn&rsquo;t been covered by the sea. I think this gives me the chance to build up my confidence and experiment with training approaches and intensities, while still pacing things out in a way so that it stays fun. I don&rsquo;t need to rush it and make myself miserable, but I don&rsquo;t want the big goal to be total vaporware.</p>
<p>For this first half marathon, my only goal right now is to run the whole thing without needing walking breaks. I don&rsquo;t want to set a firm time goal, though I&rsquo;m <em>guessing</em> I could land it somewhere between 2:15 and 2:30, if I can maintain a healthy pace for the duration. That said, I took walking breaks during my first 5k in 2019, and during my first 10k earlier this year, and even if I&rsquo;m running like a dream in the weeks leading up to the half marathon, I know there&rsquo;s a swell chance race-day nerves will kick in and I&rsquo;ll wind up coming out hot and I&rsquo;ll need to compensate later. Which will be perfectly fine‚Äîall the more reason for giving myself at least three attempts at the half distance before going on to full as I work on figuring out how to tame that tendency.</p>
<p>For my training schedule, I&rsquo;m going somewhat softly this first time, more softly in some ways than I did for the 5k in July. I&rsquo;m taking a hybrid of <a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/half-marathon-training-schedule-for-beginners-2911618">this beginner&rsquo;s plan</a> and <a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/advanced-beginner-half-marathon-training-schedule-2911617">this advanced beginer&rsquo;s plan</a>. I&rsquo;m taking the slightly more aggressive cadence of the advanced beginner&rsquo;s plan for the Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday runs, but I&rsquo;m swapping out the Sunday easy run in favor of cross-training, as suggested by the beginner&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going with the higher-mileage plan just because because I feel like I can do it, and that those few extra miles each week will help me feel more confident going into the race. Generally the miles will be easier miles than I did training for the 5k‚Äîlike, no hard interval runs, this time out, and my &ldquo;race pace&rdquo; runs I <em>think</em> will be less intense than my threshhold runs from the 5k training plan. Mostly I want to continue educating my body about what my &ldquo;next gear&rdquo; feels like, to try to get some better sense of what sustainable and potential trouble each feel like. Honestly, pace in general is a huge question mark for me, right now, which is all the more reason to treat this first attempt as an educational experiment.</p>
<p>As for the extra cross-training day on Sundays, while I was running four days a week training for the 5k, while I&rsquo;m really excited to know I can do that, I kind of want to keep that in reserve for next time. If this first round goes well, introducing the fourth day again next time should be an easy way to help me improve from there. I do also wonder if it was maybe a shade too much, what with including hard intervals and fairly hard threshhold runs in the mix. I&rsquo;m still working my confidence back up after the mild knee injury I developed during the race and I&rsquo;m not looking to aggravate that just yet. So aside from just, you know, taking it easy on my joints, I&rsquo;ve also started getting out on my bicycles again, which has felt really nice, and I&rsquo;m happy to use cross-training as an excuse to keep putting some easy miles in on the wheels.</p>
<p>All that said, I can&rsquo;t lie‚ÄîI&rsquo;m certainly already second-guessing myself, here. Was it a mistake to tell everyone so early that I&rsquo;m trying this? Is it a mistakle to try this at all? Is this actually already happening, is this real, am I really doing my first official training runs this week? I guess there&rsquo;s only one way to answer these questions.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>First of all: I did the thing.</p>
<p><em>I did the thing!</em></p>
<p>That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the post-race thought.</p>
<p>As for my thoughts about the thought&hellip;</p>
<p>Before this, any time I&rsquo;ve raced, it&rsquo;s just been to finish, to cross the finish line. This was the first time I‚Äôve trained and raced with a specific time goal. I&rsquo;m glad I went through this experiment, and not just because the training pushed me to crush my goal time. I feel like I learned a lot from it, about my range and capabilities as a runner; the effort made me stronger, the edges of my comfort zones pushed back a a couple notches, at least. And of course it kept me on track to keep running through the first hot part of summer.</p>
<p>Of course, ultimately crushing the goal time was like throwing a perfect cherry on top of the sundae&hellip;and then throwing an entire second sundae on top of that. All I <em>needed</em> to do to feel succesful was to beat my goal time by at least one second. To come in around three minutes under that time was right up there at the top end of my most optimistic, pie-in-the-sky, head-in-the-cloud secret goals.</p>
<p>My strategy for the run itself was to try to just <em>know</em> that I could do it, that I‚Äôd trained hard enough that I could just let my race day adrenaline do its thing. I pictured myself keeping things smooth but swift for the first two or so miles, so that I&rsquo;d be able to go all-out the last half-mile, but of course, my race day nerves had other plans, and I did almost the opposite of that, with a fast, hard first mile, and a second mile that wasn&rsquo;t too far off.</p>
<p>After that&hellip;I knew I was running fast and hard, but I didn&rsquo;t really know by how much. (I&rsquo;d made the conscious choice not to check my watch at all during the run, because I didn&rsquo;t want to psych myself out mid-race.) Rounding mile two I knew getting to the end was going to be as much a mental game as a physical one (oh, but it was still deeply, intensely physical!). Telling myself that whole last mile that I didn‚Äôt need to stop, that it wasn&rsquo;t time to stop yet, that I didn‚Äôt even <em>want</em> to stop, despite all the extremely hard and compelling evidence my body was throwing at me with each breath, was pretty much everything.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, that planned last half mile kick-up wasn&rsquo;t in the cards.. I knew I was already leaving everything out there I could, and the only thing left was to dig deep and keep going. Overall, my last mile was my slowest of the three, but the funny thing in retrospect is, is that it was still one of the three fastest complete miles I&rsquo;ve run maybe ever. &ldquo;Slowing down&rdquo; to what was still a ridiculously fast mile, for me? Priceless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny to think about now, but at the time, it really felt like time and space were starting todo really weird things that final stretch. That last half mile straight-away up Belle Ave grew longer the further away from Lake Erie I ran. Someone kept moving the train tracks that crossed the mid-point kept moving away from me. The road was in fact rising to meet me&hellip;by becoming a mountain directly in front of my face.</p>
<p>And then somewhere past the tracks‚Äîactually, it&rsquo;s been days since the race and I&rsquo;m still not convinced I&rsquo;ve reached those tracks yet, but I digress‚Äîamid the noise of the street festival past the finish line and the folks cheering for the runners alongside the course‚Äîthe cheers of strangers are, truly, gifts‚Äîthere was a guy walking down the sidewalk reading numbers out loud off his phone, <em>twenty-six something</em>, <em>twenty-six something plus one</em>, <em>twenty-six something plus two</em>, and time really did actually slow down for a moment, and I slipped out of my body, and I processed this information, and I realized that I wasn‚Äôt just about to reach my goal‚Äîthis big, dumb, stupid, pointless goal I‚Äôd set for myself two months earlier, that I&rsquo;d been quietly obsessing over for eight weeks‚Äîbut that I was about to obliterate it, and that realization slammed be back down into my body, and I somehow ran <em>harder</em>.</p>
<p>I may never run like that again. But to feel the <em>something else</em> that lies just below the <em>nothing left</em> briefly take over? To feel that even once was a privilege and a delight. And then going from that to crossing the finish line, running straight into my family‚Äîmy poor family, having my sweat-drenched, hyperventilating form collapsing all over them‚Äîwas just perfect.</p>

			 <p>I was chatting with a friend of mine about running, and she suggested she might come back to me for training plan advice, which is hilarious because nobody should ask me for advice about anything, ever. That said, that conversation prompted me to think I should probably brain-dump what I&rsquo;ve learned over the last eight weeks, while it&rsquo;s top of mind, even if only for my own reference later.</p>
<p>Long story short: I ran my first official 10k in May, at which point I realized I had exactly 8 weeks to go before my next race, a 5k. I&rsquo;ve been running for about 3 years at this point, though I didn&rsquo;t get really consistent with it until about last September, after completely bottoming out last summer. Coming out of this stretch of consistency, I was concerned about the summer‚ÄîI did so well during the winter, would I lose all my progress when the summer heat hit? Having a formal short-term goal on top of a real training plan felt like a good way to keep my motivation and momentum up.</p>
<p>So, I set the goal of not just making it to the 5k, but PRing at it&hellip;even if only by one second. Up to this point I&rsquo;ve mostly tried to look at speed and pace as interesting but not important. I&rsquo;m too old to need to go fast. My goals this year have been more around consistency and racking up a certain number of miles over the course of the year. But, given how I&rsquo;ve felt lately and the level consistency I&rsquo;ve maintained, speed has felt like something interesting I could play with. I&rsquo;ve felt like I <em>could</em> consciously boost my pace a bit, even if only for one race. So I decided to go for it, knowing once the race is behind me I can happily revert to easier runs to ride out the rest of the summer.</p>
<p>Training plans for running are a dime a dozen. After searching for one intended to help improve a 5k race time, <a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/5k-intermediate-run-training-2911620">I found this one at Verywell Fit</a>, which felt <em>right</em>, for me, like something I could apply to my current situation with some ease.</p>
<p>I say <em>apply</em> because I had no intention of following any plan to the letter, instead choosing to freely adjust it to meet my needs. I dropped the plan back to 4 runs a week rather than 5; up to that point I was still generally running only 3 times a week, and jumping to 5 felt like a bad idea. I&rsquo;ve been interested in trying to get an extra run in during the week, though, so it felt like 4 runs a week was a comfortable stretch I was ready to try to make.</p>
<p>I kept what I thought of as the three core runs‚Äîthe interval run (or, &ldquo;the one with lots of extremely short, stupidly fast runs&rdquo;), the tempo run (or, &ldquo;the one with the mid-length, maintainably swift run&rdquo;), and the long, slow run (or, &ldquo;the one with the I-feel-like-I-could-literally-do-this-forever run&rdquo;)‚Äîbecause I wanted to formally experiment with speed while also consciously slowing down my long run.</p>
<p>A little back story on that last point: leading up to the 10k in May I realized that I was kind of just going out and doing the same run all the time, generally going fast-for-me every time, and while I was getting faster, it also felt unsustainable. I wasn&rsquo;t playing with all the keys on the piano. Reading around online I kept seeing the same refrain about how most of your training run time should really be lighter, slower, more at a conversational pace. So even before I started the plan I was trying to learn how to slow down more often; with the plan, dedicating a couple runs each week to speed also meant trying my hardest to keep my other runs more low-key, either by pace or heart rate.</p>
<p>All told, all of this pushed me to broaden my sense of my range as a runner‚Äîwhich, yes, calling myself a &ldquo;runner&rdquo; makes me feel like a huge imposter, still, sure‚Äîto really see what I was capable of at the upper and lower ends of my dials, and to start playing around a bit more with my sense of control and feel. Should I choose to focus on speed, like I plan to do at this race, I have a better sense of what healthy speed feels like and how very bad uh-oh-bad-idea speed can feel, the difference between the pace that can get me through the first two-thirds of the race and the pace I can throw at the last half mile because there&rsquo;s no reason to hold anything back because I will never ever ever have to run ever again for as long as I live as soon as I hit that finish line (at least until I go out again for my next run sometime after the race). Whatever happens at the race, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve bettered my sense of feel.</p>
<p>As I said above I did introduce a fourth easy run to my week. With interval runs on Tuesday, tempo runs on Thursday, and my long run on Saturday, I put the easy run on Monday, thinking to give myself a rest day after my long run day (and a free night to enjoy an adult beverage or two on Saturdays, after that long run!). This worked for me, there was a nice rhythm to the week, and I&rsquo;m hoping after the race to keep the fourth run going, after a couple super easy recovery weeks. I might move it back to Sundays, to the weekend, because holy moly do the weeks feel <em>full</em> right now, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>I liked the rhythm of having at most two runs two days in a row, for me, where I&rsquo;m at now. There was one week where I did have to move my Monday easy run to Wednesday, and while I did it, while I made three days in a row work that one time, and I actually did pretty well on that Thursday tempo run, I think I still prefer the more steady rate of rest days between run days. It definitely caught up to me in the fays that followed. I&rsquo;m not there yet, at least not with those fairly intense runs in the mix.</p>
<p>I did little cross-training, because time is hard, though I did try to make sure I walked at least one good solid mile every day to help keep things loose, either as a lunchtime break or just around parks trying to keep up with my two kids. It&rsquo;s not much, but it&rsquo;s something. Again, unless the Olympics open up to middle-aged guys who drink beer for fun, what I&rsquo;m doing right now is just fine, thanks.</p>
<p>I also found a yoga routine that I liked, which occupied Wednesday nights. I&rsquo;m pretty hooked on that now. The one time I skipped that was the one week where I had some pain that tipped from &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an old man and I&rsquo;m naturally creaky and of course I hurt but it&rsquo;s, like, a <em>good</em> hurt&rdquo; over to &ldquo;Oh no, my body is 75 percent broken-down rusty old cars and 25 percent small woodland creatures making their homes inside those cars.&rdquo; That week I had to skip my tempo run and shorten my long run; that little bit of recovery space cleared the way for a strong finish, though, letting me land my first (and last, for a while!) 20+ mile week ever just last week.</p>
<p>All in all, the training plan itself went pretty well. I liked making the plan and then following it‚Äîdoing 90 percent of the thinking up front, mostly, and then just doing the doing after that. For the most part, at least. I definitely felt free to modify details as I went based on what I learned along the way. I learned a bit about when I&rsquo;m better doing a run by pace instead of heart rate; how to set my watch to give me useful information instead of just constantly screaming at me the whole time that I, a total hobbyist, was unable to consistently keep a completely consistent tempo within a narrow 20 second range; when to go a little harder and when to ease up.</p>
<p>On the flip side&hellip;putting all this time toward one specific goal that&rsquo;s going to happen in a single half-hour timespan early on a single Saturday evening is a weird headspace to be in. That&rsquo;s the mental game, though. I tell myself that what actually happens at the race doesn&rsquo;t matter‚ÄîI could absolutely flub it and have the worst run of my life, and it wouldn&rsquo;t matter one bit, because the process of getting to that point, the work and improvements I&rsquo;ve enjoyed leading up to the race, that&rsquo;s the part that really matters for me.</p>
<p>Which is a very nice thing to tell myself! And it might even be true! Still, though, obviously, of course I&rsquo;d be lying if I said that reaching that goal, perhaps even crushing it, reaching one of the <em>secret goals</em> I have locked away inside my brain for fear of ruining them by even thinking of speaking them aloud, doesn&rsquo;t actually matter to me at all. It does. Doing the thing would obviously be the incredibly delightful cherry to drop on top of this sundae. The sundae doesn&rsquo;t really need it, but it sure would look nice, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a couple easy runs ahead of me this week, a couple extra rest days, and then it&rsquo;s race day. My hope is that I&rsquo;ve both learned a few things that will help me run a better race than I have in the past, and that I&rsquo;ve also conditioned my system enough so that I comfortably take all my extra race-day adrenaline and pour it all out onto the race course. Whatever happens, it&rsquo;s not going to matter, but also, I feel pretty good about what could happen.</p>
<p>Once I actually get to do the thing. Can I just do it right now? Get it over with? That&rsquo;d be nice. No? No? Darn. Worth the ask, anyway.</p>

			 <p>I started running in 2019 in order to do the <a href="https://runsignup.com/Race/OH/Cleveland/StrollRoll5K1MileFunRun">MetroHealth Friends of Mothers &amp; Infants Stroll &amp; Roll 5K</a>. The race supports a great cause, and in just a few months, it forced me to go from ‚ÄúRunning a full mile would be kind of a neat thing to do!‚Äù to ‚ÄúWow, I just ran three miles! Nobody in the history of the world has ever done that before! I am <em>amazing</em>!‚Äù</p>
<p>And then I kept running.</p>
<p>Kind of.</p>
<p>Looking back, I realize my consistency those first two years was very hit or miss. I&rsquo;m not surprised that it culminated in a full-scale break-down blow-out &ldquo;This is stupid! I quit! And&hellip;and‚Ä¶did I mention this is stupid?&rdquo; moment last summer. There were other factors at play, sure, but also, it was stupid and running was stupid and I quit.</p>
<p>Turns out, sometimes quitting is smart. I needed to walk away from my running-induced frustrations for a while. After clearing my head, I realized running wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> stupid. And that I wasn&rsquo;t ready to quit.</p>
<p>So I started back up September with a nice easy 1 mile run.</p>
<p>And <em>then</em> I kept running.</p>
<p>Not every specific run has been fun, obviously, but running itself has been fun in general. I&rsquo;m not setting world records, I&rsquo;m not looking to compete against others. But my confidence and enjoyment have both increased.</p>
<p>Races have helped. I did the Stroll &amp; Roll again in the fall, and then I ran a chilly 5k at the <a href="https://www.clewestrunningclub.org/fall-classic.html">Cleveland Fall Classic</a>, and then in the spring I achieved the personal bucket list item of doing a 5k in under 30 minutes at the <a href="https://runsignup.com/Race/OH/Cleveland/TreatYoSelf">Treat Yo Self 5k</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out, consistency is good. Who knew! Doing the thing means you can do the thing! And I‚Äôm pretty sure I have gotten better at doing the thing, too. Now, I think, from a certain angle, if you squint at the last nine months <em>just</em> right, I think you can safely say that I‚Äôve gone from ‚Äúvery slow but well-meaning‚Äù to ‚Äúkind of actually approaching something resembling thoroughly average‚Äù.</p>
<p>Progress!</p>
<p>Most recently I ran the 10k the weekend of the <a href="https://www.clevelandmarathon.com/">Cleveland Marathon</a>, where I didn&rsquo;t do as well as I&rsquo;d hoped I would, and am totally and completely fine with that. What mattered to me more was just doing it at all, getting the experience of it, the education from it, and also oh yeah surprising myself with some really great runs leading up to the race.</p>
<p>And, just, I mean&hellip;I did the thing! It&rsquo;s possible I wore my finisher medal around the house for about a week afterward! Ask my family how much fun and totally not insufferable I am!</p>
<p>Next up, I&rsquo;m running the <a href="https://runsignup.com/Race/OH/Lakewood/SummerMeltdown5K">Lakewood Summer Meltdown 5k</a>. This race happens in shouting distance of my house and I&rsquo;ve wanted to do it since I started running. Since even before that: being a bystander at the party in the preceding years, seeing people crossing the finish line, feeling the energy in the air around it all, I think that contributed a lot to me even <em>thinking</em> about starting running.</p>
<p>After I finished the 10k in May I realized I had exactly 8 weeks until the Meltdown 5k. It felt like a good time to experiment with my running schedule and explore different kinds of runs, with the goal of getting my speed up, even just a quarter-notch or so, in order to try to set a new 5k PR at the race. Lo and behold, I found <a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/5k-intermediate-run-training-2911620">a training plan that catered exactly to that</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about halfway through this 8 week session. I think it&rsquo;s been going well! I stepped that plan back slightly at the outset‚Äîbefore this I was only running 3 days a week; and 5 felt like it would have been too much of a jump, especially for an old man like me, but 4 felt like a nice, attainable stretch goal, a limit I could get behind pushing. So I&rsquo;m following the interval run, tempo run, and long run routine, with an extra easy run mixed in there.</p>
<p>This has smoothly but also dramatically pushed my weekly mileage up each week from where I was around the time of the 10k. It&rsquo;s also varied the kinds of miles I&rsquo;m running, which has been educational. Consciously doing &ldquo;easier&rdquo; miles has felt weird, even for someone who doesn&rsquo;t really go all that fast when he&rsquo;s going his fastest, but getting a broader sense of my range, a greater feel for what I can do (run 0.25 mile sprint at a sub-7:30 pace!) and can‚Äôt do (run a 0.25 mile sprint at a sub-7:30 pace if I‚Äôm going to do more than a few of those sprints in a single session!) has been interesting. It&rsquo;s fun to know what my hardest-run interval feels like, compared to those easy-breezy I-could-do-this-forever slow-boat long-run miles. Also turns out I absolutely love whatever passes for my version of a tempo run. Cool! That probably means I‚Äôm doing it wrong! Bummer!</p>
<p>As for my race goal, if I can shave just one second off my last 5k race time, this will be a total and complete personal victory. And if I don‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt. But I think I can. So I‚Äôm going to go for it.</p>
<p>After that, I‚Äôm pondering where I‚Äôm going to go from here. There‚Äôs a lot of options, now, which is kind of a wild place to be.</p>
