		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>So I did the half marathon!</p>
<p>First off—amazing experience. Considering I went from three weeks out thinking &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still injured, I&rsquo;m not doing anything&rdquo; to two weeks out thinking &ldquo;Maybe I can walk it?&rdquo; to one week out thinking &ldquo;Well, I can run a <em>little</em> of it, at least,&rdquo; what I wound up actually doing felt incredible.</p>
<p>My plan was fluxing pretty much up til race day, with the hard limit of knowing I couldn&rsquo;t run the whole way—I had to stay conservative if I wanted to be sure I was going to make it to the finish line, coming off the leg injury that imploded my full marathon training. Where I pretty much wound up was, was that I wanted to run the first mile, and then I wanted to run the last two miles, and then I was going to alternate half-mile walks with running stretches for the remainder of the race, knowing of course that everything would depend on how I felt in the moment, and that the whole thing was likely to go up in smoke at a moment&rsquo;s bad turn.</p>
<p>I wound up doing nearly the best possible version of that plan. Did the first mile, broke to walk, did another mile, broke to walk. Three miles in and was feeling good and so I started to stretch the runs and shorten the breaks, and I started feeling like I could live-adjust my distances to try to fit the water stations in to walking stretches. Somewhere in the middle I had a solid two mile stretch, that was definitely not in the plan. I had some surprisingly quick miles in there along the way. And I was just feeling <em>good</em>.</p>
<p>Coming toward the end, a big reason for wanting to run out the last two miles was because the mile 11 marker comes right before the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hope_Memorial_Bridge">Hope Memorial Bridge</a>, the one with <a href="https://www.ideastream.org/news/exploring-the-history-and-popularity-of-cleveland-s-guardians-of-traffic">the Guardians of Traffic statues</a>, which is about as iconic of a mile as I suspect you can find in Cleveland; I <em>really</em> didn&rsquo;t want to miss that stretch. And then of course you&rsquo;ve only got a mile left after that so I mean might as well run it out, right?</p>
<p>I also had it in the back of my mind that for as conservatively as I was running the rest of the race, if I got through mile 12, I&rsquo;d give myself permission to do something possibly a little dumb that last mile. (As a little treat!) And I felt so good coming off the bridge that I felt okay kicking it up a gear for the last mile, until I was basically sprinting into the finish. My pace rose by around two full minutes over the course of the last two miles. I kind of thought I was going to die at the end and it was the most incredible feeling imaginable.</p>
<p>Overall the race was a great experience. The one other formal half marathon I&rsquo;ve done was a couple Novembers ago, taking place on a very cold, very very cold, very very very cold day in the <a href="https://www.clevelandmetroparks.com/">Metroparks</a>, on a double-out-and-back path. I will always have a soft spot for that race and I hope to do it again in the future, but it was comparatively a much smaller experience, with less crowd support and a race crowd that probably skewed a bit more toward harder-core, faster runners, I think?</p>
<p>This race, however, with several thousand people out there on the course, was so energizing. While I didn&rsquo;t know anybody I was running near I also never felt like I was alone, as I was constantly surrounded by other runners. Seeing lots of other folks doing intervals was reassuring as well. And the crowd support surrounding the course was so cool—there&rsquo;s no doubt my pace picked up every time I passed through groups of onlookers. (I hope it was obvious when I was laughing at the signs, too, that it didn&rsquo;t just look like I was making anguished faces!) It&rsquo;s a cool experience to be part of something putting out that much positive energy into the world.</p>
<p>As for final race time—I didn&rsquo;t have any goal, of course, other than to get to the finish line in one piece, but even with the walk breaks, I wound up coming in only about 6 minutes behind where I landed at my previous half marathon race. Which, I mean. Wow!?! Where did that even come from? I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s of course so many other little details that stick, of course. Of course there was the banana suit guy, somewhere out there. Of course I saw a much older-than-me woman well ahead of me running barefoot like it was no big deal. Of course I heard <em>lots</em> of poop jokes. (So many poop jokes.) Of course there was the guy standing on his front porch who, right as I was passing by, said, &ldquo;Hey, y&rsquo;all wanna slow down a bit, I&rsquo;m about to twist one up.&rdquo; Of course there&rsquo;s finishing my half marathon run as the winners of the <em>full marathon</em> were rolling in. (I mean, my god. I&rsquo;m still catching my breath from my finishing half mile.) Of course the beers at the finishing line party were the greatest things I&rsquo;ve ever tasted in my entire life. And of course there were the congratulatory chalk drawings from my kids in the driveway when I got home. Of course and of course and of course.</p>

			 <p>So—went to urgent care yesterday. Basically confirmed (I hope!) that the leg&rsquo;s nothing <em>worse</em> than I feared. No reason to suspect a stress fracture or a muscle tear or anything truly devastating. So I&rsquo;m not <em>underestimating</em> how bad it is, not treating it too lightly, which is good.</p>
<p>Got some antiinflammatory pills to hopefully calm things down, and I&rsquo;m finishing out this week (again) with no running. Then, hopefully, if everything feels good early next week, I can try getting back into it.</p>
<p>The doc at the clinic was very encouraging—&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try to think positive thoughts here!&quot;—that I can still get back to marathon training in time for the race. I&rsquo;m&hellip;encouraged, but less certain&hellip;hopeful, but not convinced? Something. If nothing else, I&rsquo;ve at least gone back from &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done, stick a fork in me&rdquo; to &ldquo;Well&hellip;maaa-a-aybe I can still do this?&rdquo; which is at least a more productive headspace to be in.</p>
<p>Of course everything&rsquo;s a bit hypothetical at this point and depends on what happens next week when I try to start back up. How well that first run goes, much can and how quickly I can build back up without immediately blowing back out, how much of my taper period I can compress in favor of getting those long runs in&hellip;basically how much of the training calendar I can rewrite on the fly both conservatively and aggressively.</p>
<p>To my surprise I can say I (optimistically) still see a path to getting this done. It&rsquo;s a narrow one! But it&rsquo;s good to at least still have some hope.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also possible that if I&rsquo;m feeling good when I get back up and going but not <em>marathon</em> good that I could drop back to the half marathon. I mean, funny to think of a half marathon as a &ldquo;consolation prize&rdquo; at this point but it would certainly be better than nothing!</p>
<p>Nothing to do right now but wait a bit and see what&rsquo;s what next week (and play out hypothetical scenarios in my mind over and over again while I wait!).</p>
<p>(Also, funny coincidence—I&rsquo;ve been listening through <a href="https://www.beyondflg.com/thebuildup">The Build Up podcast</a> over the last month or so, about Molly Seidel&rsquo;s (ultimately ended) training for the U.S. Olympics marathon trials, and the final episode, in which she talks about her knee injury and how she had to skip the trials, came up in the Overcast queue on my way to the clinic. Interesting listening.)</p>

			 <p>Good news is my leg&rsquo;s been feeling progressively better each day since <a href="https://darby3.micro.blog/2024/03/23/todays-run-did.html">the run I ended early on Saturday</a>. Taking it easy and getting a couple good nights sleep has definitely helped. It&rsquo;s still a bit sore, I guess, when I push off from it or stretch it <em>just so</em>, but I think it&rsquo;s heading in the right direction. I took a mile walk over lunch and I don&rsquo;t think I was too obviously limping the whole time, which is swell. I also think it actually felt better at the end than it did at the beginning—so I&rsquo;m crossing my fingers that I&rsquo;m at the point where it&rsquo;s basically okay, or close to okay, and I can focus on loosening it back up and starting to move back toward moving forward again.</p>
<p>So, as much as I was worried it was going to be a training-killer, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going that way. Probably. Hopefully! Of course now I&rsquo;m just dealing with the impatience of not knowing <em>exactly</em> when I&rsquo;m going to be running again and what the next long run&rsquo;s going to look like. Two &ldquo;bad&rdquo; long runs have me itching to really nail one so I can feel like I&rsquo;m still on track. As much as running is a physical game it&rsquo;s also still definitely a mental game and right now those two games are clashing pretty hard.</p>
<p>My current plan is to probably do some elliptical tomorrow and I&rsquo;ll see how it feels after that. All things going swimmingly I&rsquo;m <em>hoping</em> I can do a couple runs Wednesday and Thursday, and if those go okay, then I can do my scheduled long run Saturday (16 miles!). It would feel really good to get that one done properly. That said, if the week doesn&rsquo;t go great, I might start thinking about some bigger schedule changes ahead of May, or even possibly dropping back to the half marathon event in May and regrouping for another attempt at a full later in the year.</p>
<p>Right now, just trying to take the week ahead one day at a time, and hoping like heck this turns out to just be a minor glitch on the path forward.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Today’s run was…fine but not great? Not the run I hoped for while also being totally acceptable? Somehow all of these at the same time? Definitely one to both shake off and also learn from.</p>
<p>Lesson one: despite the fact that it felt chilly and breezy at the start, it still quickly became a T-shirt only run. Keeping the sweatshirt on when I set out—I know exactly why I did it but whoops that was a mistake! Lesson being, pay attention to that weather report.</p>
<p>Lesson two: I’ve definitely been losing sight of what a “slow” long run looks like for me. My “faster slow” of late has been fun. But it was also bound to bite me in the butt eventually.</p>
<p>Lesson three: whatever “climbing” I work into my weekly routine is definitely not enough for the hillier path I tried to tackle today. Worth doing actual hill repeats if I’m going back that way.</p>
<p>Long story short, got through mile seven of 13 and just knew it wasn’t in the cards. (My heart rate record on my watch backed me up after the run when I saw where it landed.) Wound up doing a bunch of walking breaks for the last six, which I know is perfectly fine and I knew it was absolutely what I needed but at the same time wasn’t what I wanted to be doing out there. So I’m both glad I did and also frustrated I had to.</p>
<p>So on the one hand there’s nothing to be actually upset about here, but on the other I know how this goes, that I’ll feel a bit off-center about all of this until I can recoup with some solid runs again. Onward…</p>

			 <p>Last week&rsquo;s runs added up to kind of a big jump for the week with my run Saturday being a 12 miler and yet it is weird just how much it felt almost like no big deal. (Almost!) I could feel the grind of the run a bit for a while in the middle, but at the same time I never doubted <em>too</em> much that I would finish, never felt like I had to ease back much or anything. If anything I was probably running the whole thing harder than I expected to or than I probably ought to have&hellip;but it also felt kind of good, so, I guess, what do I know? Still, I was definitely feeling a bit stiff and achy when I got up for today&rsquo;s 3 miler. But, like, not to the point of <em>not</em> being able to run today. Definitely wasn&rsquo;t pushing the pace or anything though. And I will absolutely plan on trying to consciously go easier on this weekend&rsquo;s 13 miler, for sure.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that as I reach this &ldquo;mid-point&rdquo; of the marathon training cycle, when I reach that half-marathon distance again, which is the point I&rsquo;d said would be my real check-in about going forward and finishing out the plan&hellip;I&rsquo;m feeling generally more confident that I&rsquo;ll probably be putting money down on the race this time next week. I think!</p>

			 <p>And in the blink of an eye I&rsquo;m past the sixth week of my 18 week marathon training plan. My weekend long run was &ldquo;short&rdquo; this week (a mere seven miles!) and as I bumped my Thursday run to Wednesday (because rain) I had the unusual opportunity to get my weekend run in this morning before work. So now I have a run-free weekend ahead of me. But really mostly it meant a basic logistics check, doing a test run of a weekday long run. I&rsquo;ve got more of those coming up on the calendar in the coming weeks (this week my midweek run goes to six), and it was nice to confirm that the time I think I have to get up for these longer runs is probably actually going to work. At least through the eight mile mark—I think I&rsquo;m taking days off work for my 9 and 10 mile mid-week runs, which is about the point I&rsquo;d have to start getting out of bed about the same time I&rsquo;d be getting into bed&hellip;</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m technically three weeks into marathon training and I don’t think I’ve gone into any real detail yet on what my training plan or goals look like. Partially because the first three weeks have felt so &ldquo;light&rdquo; it’s hardly felt like I’ve been training for anything yet, and partially because I&rsquo;ve yet to fully convince myself I actually <em>am</em> training.</p>
<p>The way I&rsquo;m looking at this right now is, I&rsquo;m definitely absolutely totally training for a marathon, but I haven’t fully committed to which one, yet. My current goal is to do <a href="https://www.clevelandmarathon.com/">the Cleveland Marathon in May</a>; if I miss that, for whatever reason, I&rsquo;ve got at least one local backup marathon, <a href="https://www.canalwaypartners.com/events/2024/10/05/the-towpath-marathon">the Towpath Marathon, in October</a>, I can fall back on. I’m sure there’s others I could target in there but I’m not ready to plan on traveling to an event yet.</p>
<p>My hesitancy here stems from how, coming out of the end of last year, I didn’t know if I&rsquo;d have the get up and go to keep getting up and going outside in the dead of winter to start very quickly training again for a May race. This felt like a valid concern at a point when I was really looking forward to a break! After three weeks, though, for as much as I sure do want to burrow away and hibernate until April because it has <em>sucked</em> out there, I&rsquo;ve still definitely actually been getting out there. So if nothing else, there&rsquo;s reason for cautious optimism, there!</p>
<p>As for the plan I&rsquo;m following, after looking at a bunch of first-timer options, all offering various blends of &ldquo;go run a lot, and then run some more, and then keep running,” I&rsquo;ve taken to <a href="https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-1-marathon/">the Hal Higdon Novice I plan</a> as my starting point, because it seems both attainable and kind of interesting. On the one hand it feels attainable, like it’s just chill enough to help me just get to the finish line without worrying about things I don’t need to worry about this time, while on the other hand, the rhythm of the plan is interesting, compared to how I worked up to half marathon lengths in the fall. That round I was keeping my weekday runs all balanced, roughly the same length, plus or minus a mile, while the weekend long run was, of course, long. The Higdon plan packs more of the midweek mileage into one of those runs, so you’re kind of sandwiching a longer midweek run between two shorter runs. It feels a little funky and intriguing and I&rsquo;m curious to see if I can make it work. That said, I&rsquo;m reserving the right to balance those weekday as needed if I find myself losing consciousness during certain workdays.</p>
<p>Other mild modifications: I’m squeezing a cross-training day (light elliptical) into the week instead of doing that on the weekend, so I’ve been active Monday through Thursday, with rest days before and after the long run on Saturday, so I have at least one night a week when I can enjoy a beverage or two after we finally get the kids to bed and before I pass out on the couch. I’m also stepping things up <em>just a skitch</em> by introducing some informal speed work in during the week, because after a year of not doing that at all, I’ve felt like I’ve missed it. Nothing crazy, just an informal mile of fartlek intervals here, a little more steady pace running there. I&rsquo;m staying conservative with it but it does feel nice to pull those other levers again.</p>
<p>As for strength training, I&rsquo;m&hellip;opting not to freak out about it. It remains an inconsistent weakness of mine, but then, there&rsquo;s just only so much time. I would like to get some body weight stuff again in somehow, but I haven’t figured out how to actually make that work with my schedule.</p>
<p>No pace or time goals for the race itself, beyond finishing, ideally without walking. I&rsquo;m completely happy with knowing I’m a slow runner, of course—like, if I came in faster than five hours, I&rsquo;d probably assume a timer malfunction. I do still hope to run the whole route, without walking, because while I know there is absolutely nothing wrong with walk-run methods or walking breaks, I&rsquo;m still weirdly stubbornly committed to trying not to do that. It’s maybe my one version of upping the ante, or keeping the ante consistent, for myself.</p>
<p>As for when I’ll commit to a race, I’m chunking the 18 week plan into two pieces, with the goal right now of just getting to week 8, when I&rsquo;ll be back up at the half marathon length again for the weekend long run. Once I hit that point, sometime in early March, if I’m feeling good, if I’m feeling strong, then I’ll feel better about putting money down for the May race. If not, October is, relatively speaking, just around the corner(!), but I’ll have plenty of time to reassess and plan accordingly. One way or another I do think that finish line is in my future.</p>

			 <p>Set up a run mileage grid tracker for the year.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think I tried setting up a year-long view like this before, but it didn’t work out. But, at the end of last year, when I was training up for my big end-of-year runs, I had penciled out those last 13 weeks in a grid like this, and it became both a nice way to keep track of the coming weeks, and a pleasant minor part of the routine, just moving those pencil marks over to pen. A little moment of, “Hey, yeah, cool. I did that. Cool.”</p>
<p>I’ve finished up my first easy week of the year and I’m feeling pretty good right now. The (brief) downtime is nice. I’ll do something similar next week, which then should flow naturally right on in to the part where I’ve got the first 8 weeks of an 18 week marathon plan penciled in on the tracker. That’s the part that gets me back up to 13 miles on the weekend long runs.</p>
<p>I’m still on the fence about whether to really commit to the Cleveland spring marathon, but I figure if I get through these first 8 (winter!) weeks and I’m still feeling good, if I’m into it, despite everything the Cleveland winter might or might not throw at me, then I can feel pretty good about committing to the last 10 weeks. If I’m not feeling it, yet, for whatever reason—no harm, no foul, I’ve got an easy out while there’s plenty of time to reassess and replan for something in the summer or fall.</p>
<p>On one hand this approach feels a little bet-hedge-y, but on the other I think it’s helping me keep the right attitude going into the year. The ultimate goal is still to do a marathon, but I also want to remain somewhat realistic about where my head and/or body are at, right now and in the months to come. Those long runs are…really long!</p>

The weekend long run will be down to 10 from last weekend&rsquo;s 12. And then it&rsquo;s up and up again the following two weeks, to the big target 13.1+ miler just before the holiday. (Don&rsquo;t tell anyone, but my secret goal is a 14 miler that weekend. Shhh.) And then the last week of the year will be a relaxing hot holiday mess and god willing I will not be waking up at 5:30 am for any runs that week. That said I think if I can squeeze out about 12 miles total that last week I&rsquo;ll manage to hit my first 100 mile month ever, which is wild. Considering I had my first true zero-miles month since 2021 earlier this year, and was seriously starting to consider whether running was even for me anymore, it feels good to have bounced back up out of the holes I&rsquo;ve fallen into along the way to end the year on a high note.</p>

			 <p>Technically a &ldquo;down&rdquo; week for running, with the coming weekend long run down to 6 miles from last week&rsquo;s 8. Still, using it as a chance to get the last of my three weekday runs up to 4 miles. I did not mind the extra minutes in today&rsquo;s freakish mid-60s temps one bit. 🏃</p>

			 <p>Once upon a time I was a math guy.</p>
<p>Like, when I went to college, I was going to double major in English and Math, which is crazy to think about today. It did not go well! I did not make the transition from high school math to advanced math successfully, in part because it got <em>real</em> hard—nothing can quite prepares you for the part where math suddenly stops seeming to have much to do with numbers. (It gets weird, doesn&rsquo;t it?) Also in part because I discovered writing and realized I really wanted to do writing. (Or at least I really wanted to &ldquo;be a writer,&rdquo; which is different, of course, isn&rsquo;t it?) And also in part because, well, girls. (An uninteresting guy has gotta have something to write about, right?)</p>
<p>I managed to escape college with a math minor, making way for a creative writing minor. Now it&rsquo;s <em>*mumbles unintelligently*</em> years later and <em>sure</em> I still write, sort of, and sure some aspects of mathematical thinking inform my ability to make computers do things, but, like&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know. I wonder how much college Darby would recognize adult-with-mortgage Darby. If the two would have much to talk about.</p>
<p>My dreams are far more idle these days.</p>
<p>Once in a while something tweaks and fidgets some old dormant strain of me and I catch myself wondering how much of those old pathways still exist, how much they dangle into empty but inviting space; if I picked up a calculus book, today, if I looked at the texts that came next, could I make heads or tails of any of it? I have no time for it, I have other things I can actually do in the little time I have, and yet some diluted flavor of curiosity lingers, even after all these years.</p>
<p>I also still think a bit about the notion from my one chaos theory class that you&rsquo;ll eventually get everywhere when you run the same equation long enough and I suppose that would be more metaphorically informative today if I had an actual idea where I was trying to get to with this kind of line of thinking. And also I&rsquo;ve probably got that whole concept wrong, because, well, yeah. Math got hard.</p>

			 <p>Being less conservative than usual in my back-to-running plan this time out means jumping right back into back-to-back Monday-Tuesday runs; I was very cautious about that on my original back-to-running session earlier this year, after taking seven-ish weeks off, but I&rsquo;m hoping that after only three-ish weeks off this time I can start at a slightly higher baseline. So: did three miles yesterday and today and definitely felt like I was working for it this morning—note to self: those dining room chairs aren&rsquo;t the friendliest choices for extended sitting when writing the night before—but the good news is, I made it, and, sure, while I&rsquo;m feeling a touch creakier than I&rsquo;d prefer right now, I&rsquo;m also not absolutely miserable, it all kind of feels like it&rsquo;s in the acceptable bounds of reason. Onward, etc.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>&ldquo;This Moron Thinks He&rsquo;s Still Going to Run a Marathon Someday!&rdquo; is the <em>Onion</em> headline I&rsquo;ve been mentally drafting about myself as I&rsquo;ve started <em>restarting</em> running <em>yet again</em> the last few days. It&rsquo;s funny because it&rsquo;s true!</p>
<p>Look, saying this year has <em>disappointed</em> only represents part of the story. I&rsquo;ve had some low lows but also some high highs. Getting knocked out of training for this last race has felt particularly unfair—I don&rsquo;t even think the injury was running related!—but then also I&rsquo;ve has some pleasing builds and surprising gains along the way this year. There&rsquo;s been enough of all the good stuff so that when I start finding myself thinking that maybe I&rsquo;m done with this whole phase of my life I soon thereafter start thinking, naw, I&rsquo;m not.</p>
<p>So, now, I&rsquo;ve got three months to go, this year, and while I won&rsquo;t make my race goal, I&rsquo;m thinking maybe, <em>maybe</em>, I can still make it back up to the 13 mile long run marker, on my own? Maybe. It&rsquo;s not a race but it&rsquo;s still a goal and I like goals. And then from there if nothing&rsquo;s breaking too violently or creaking too loudly maybe next year it&rsquo;s just time to go for broke and try for a full marathon. I&rsquo;m clearly not getting younger, I <em>guess</em>. And maybe I&rsquo;ve got all the nonsense out of my way this past year, maybe. Or not! I don&rsquo;t know. Who knows.</p>
<p>The good news I&rsquo;ve started back up again and I&rsquo;m two runs in and instead of my usual super slow start I&rsquo;ve convinced myself that three mile runs are still in my range and though they&rsquo;ve certainly taken a bit of do-I-even-run-bro effort to finish up I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m going to immediately die in the aftermath, so that&rsquo;s good. Have to start (again) somewhere, in any event; I mean, big goals aside I just need to get through the next couple weeks and get back into a baseline basic swing of things, first and foremost.</p>

(Biblio has some multiple-hundred dollar copies up for sale, which, no thank you.) Finally just thought to check the local libraries and while the <a href="https://www.lakewoodpubliclibrary.org/">Lakewood Public Library</a> doesn&rsquo;t have it the <a href="https://cpl.org/">Cleveland Public Library</a> does have a couple copies floating around.

Too soon to tell yet if the new one will reach that level for me, but, so far, I&rsquo;m into it; I like how it somewhat surprisingly sounds like a natural extension of what they did on that previous album, but with all these new sounds and moods pulled in. 🎶</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to <a href="https://www.blankcheckpod.com/">the Blank Check podcast</a> a bit lately. It&rsquo;s fun.</p>
<p>Yesterday I finally listened to their <em>Oppenheimer</em> episode and aside from getting me really excited about that movie again (for the record, I think that film was monumental) I realized that after seeing that movie opening weekend I let it wash over me in the days that followed but somehow avoided engagement with most of the resulting discourse around it; instead, I mostly stewed in my own thoughts about it. There were some unavoidable, and reductive, nuggets of talk that got tossed in my path, of course—concern that the movie didn&rsquo;t show the actual bombings, for example, or that the movie didn&rsquo;t deal enough with Oppenheimer&rsquo;s feelings of guilt, I guess? Hearing some of those things discussed in some nuance was intriguing; hearing some of my own unspoken thoughts reflected back at me in this little audio time capsule was, well, I hesitate to say validating, so let&rsquo;s just say <em>also</em> intriguing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to watching that movie again some day, even though I know it won&rsquo;t rival my unduplicatable opening weekend front-row Imax experience. I also want to go back and watch a bunch of other Christopher Nolan movies that I haven&rsquo;t seen in a while.</p>
<p>(Also, can I get <em>Tenet</em> back in theaters? I thought it was great, but I wish I could see it again, you know, the &ldquo;right&rdquo; way.)</p>

			 <p>In other news, entering the very very very final week of DVD.com (Netflix DVD!) has me feeling weird feels.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been feeling weird feels about the whole concept of &ldquo;endings&rdquo; for a while now anyway. Probably specifically since watching the movie <em>Aniara</em>. (Which I watched on a rental disc, thank you very much.)</p>
<p>Seeing semifrequent comments out there in the wild about folks not even owning disc players anymore at a time when I&rsquo;m mourning the loss of a service that has provided incredibly convenient rental access to media often only available in physical formats is&hellip;kind of a lot.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got quite a backlog of physical discs from Criterion and other boutique labels on our shelves, that have been waiting in the wings while I&rsquo;ve tried to hammer through as much of the DVD.com queue as possible.</p>
<p>I mean, not that getting through the queue was ever a possibility—I&rsquo;ve been actually <em>increasing</em> its length this last month, for reasons—but it&rsquo;s been fun to watch through lots of stuff for all the reasons I&rsquo;ve liked getting stuff through that channel. Stuff we&rsquo;d be renting one-offs of digitally, or just getting more cheaply via the dvd service, or just getting it on physical format because it&rsquo;s not available any other way, or because as a discovery service it&rsquo;s been an absolutely delightful way to chuck seemingly random stuff into the queue and then, well, you just kind of watch it, because, what the heck, why not?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s certainly other ways to get this stuff, in the future. Buying more stuff. Our local library systems are good. I&rsquo;ve signed up for a Scarecrow Video account which will probably get some use.</p>
<p>Still, though: those red envelopes folks thought were already consigned to the dustbin of history, finally actually being consigned to the dustbin of history&hellip;it&rsquo;s a thing, isn&rsquo;t it.</p>

On the other hand, I quit Twitter for many good reasons, and yet I now feel like I have multiple faux-Twitters in my life. We&rsquo;ll see whether the pros outweigh the cons.</p>

			 <p>About seven weeks ago I dropped out of my half-marathon training around the midpoint of the twelve-week plan. After weeks of struggling through various pains, I’d had enough. It sucked. Going into training, I thought I was in a really good place. And then I wasn’t.</p>
<p>Seven weeks is about the longest I’ve taken off from running since 2021. That time I think I rage quit because I wasn’t having fun and I was running very poorly. That time I needed the mental break; this time I needed the physical break. I know both breaks were necessary. That first time I needed a hard reset. This time around, though, I mentally felt ready for anything, at a time when my body decided to give me the finger. I’ve been striving toward the point where consistent, regular running was a natural part of my routine, so I could alternate progressing up toward new goals and floating back down to a solid, easy base. Needless to say, it did not work out like that.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to dwell on any of this. I do want to put a bow on it as I start to move on. Several times over the last month or so I’ve sincerely toyed with the thought that maybe that was actually it, maybe I’m done now, maybe I just won’t go back.</p>
<p>ButI I’m going back. Just this week I started back up again at something like square one&hellip;.one mile runs, that is! Which isn’t <em>actually</em> square one—I’m still light-years beyond where I was when I started running in 2019. I do not want to take that for granted. Still, as eager as I am mentally to get back to long-as-heck weekend runs, I know it’s going to be a while and I know how important it is to ease back up to where I actually want to be.</p>
<p>And, yes, even just getting out there for fifteen minutes last night felt nice, like a taste of something that I know has been missing the last few weeks. I haven’t been idle since I stopped training. I mean, yes, I took a hard week off at the start, and last week was a low one, and I’ve been a bit all over the place in the middle, but I have been trying to at least get up on the elliptical for some easier movement, and I’ve also been once again trying to get into something resembling a regular strength routine, specifically body weight exercises targeting my leg muscles in an effort to give my knees some support. Finding things I actually don’t mind doing has been a nice turn and I know it’s important now to figure out how to keep that stuff going as I start to slide back into running. Making the time for it sucks but then not doing anything sucks even more, so.</p>
<p>Aaaaaand of course today I started marking out races and potential training start dates on my calendar, so&hellip;no pressure, of course, but also, it&rsquo;s nice to feel like I have those goals back in front of me, still.</p>

			 <p>I’m continuing to do a very silly thing this year <a href="https://darby3.micro.blog/2023/01/09/184300.html">that I described here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://darby3.micro.blog/2023/03/22/february-running-music.html">My February list is here</a> and my March list is below. <a href="https://tidal.com/browse/playlist/a58857d7-b47e-4cf8-b382-bc77304be4bc">Here&rsquo;s a playlist of tracks from it</a>. As usual: probably not a good list to try to run to.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Con Todo El Mundo</em> by Khruangbin</strong>. (Chill vibes.)</li>
<li><strong><em>The Head on the Door</em> by The Cure</strong>. (Kind of a weird choice of a Cure album to run to. But then I guess any Cure album would be kind of a weird choice for a run.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Mariner</em> by Cult of Luna and Julie Christmas</strong>. (I&rsquo;ve gotten loosely more into heavier music and metal music over the last few years. This one is an absolute gem; I like other albums by Cult of Luna, but this one&rsquo;s so good. I&rsquo;ve a particular fondness for metal with lady singers who actually, like, sing; that contrast is an absolute delight. No offense intended to the stereotypical metal male scream-style vocal, which I&rsquo;ve come to mind <em>less</em> over the years—it has its place and purpose for me—but stuff like this is just so my jam. Hitting the end of this album and not feeling a bit like you&rsquo;re doing <em>the most epic run ever</em> is probably out of the question. I mean, if you&rsquo;re into that sort of thing.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Dive</em> by Tycho</strong>. (The chillest vibes.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Every Open Eye</em> by Chvrches</strong>. (I might have to throw <a href="https://darby3.micro.blog/2023/01/09/184300.html">a loophole clause</a> out there for this one; I think the run was too bad to warrant keeping this wonderful album off the list for the rest of the year. If nothing else the back-to-back attack of &ldquo;Playing Dead&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bury It&rdquo; would probably show up on any time-to-get-it-done running mix I ever make.)</li>
<li><strong><em>The Heart is a Monster</em> by Failure</strong>. (Good long run vibes; it&rsquo;s a whole journey. It&rsquo;s also, weirdly, the only Failure album I&rsquo;ve really gotten into. I didn&rsquo;t know them during their initial run and so I&rsquo;m not sure why I threw this on when it originally came out but I got into it pretty hard; nothing else since has quite clicked for me and while I know I&rsquo;ve gone back to their older stuff to check it out, this is the one I keep coming back to whenever I need whatever it is they give me.)</li>
<li><strong><em>A Gaze Among Them</em> by Big|Brave</strong>. (More heavy vibes with good lady vocals.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Nightstand</em> by Tancred</strong>. (More chill vibes.)</li>
<li><strong><em>In Sides</em> by Orbital</strong>. (I mean, this is probably, categorically, one of the best long run albums in my rotation.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Little Red</em> by Katy B</strong>. (She&rsquo;s so good.)</li>
</ol>
<p>There&rsquo;s fewer albums this time in part because training&rsquo;s been messier than usual this month and in part because I started shuffling in some DJ mixes from Soundcloud on race pace and tempo nights.</p>
<p>I have <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dukakis88/sets/run-for-fun">a somewhat curated playlist of elctronic/techno mixes here</a> that I can pretty reliably hit shuffle on and get a good running mix—mostly because all those come from a much longer and less curated list I&rsquo;ve been shuffling mixes out of for a while; the ones that feel good get promoted to the public list. I&rsquo;ve come to like reserving these mixes for &ldquo;pace&rdquo; runs, which seem to call for a more immersive flow. They also do tend to make me want to try to go a little harder than I usually do. It&rsquo;s all a whole thing, isn&rsquo;t it.</p>

			 <p>Like a good Micro.blogger, I&rsquo;m finally playing around with <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a>. I think I like it! I have some thoughts. (Which I&rsquo;m writing up in Drafts, of course.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Having text I feel some need to put down, and being able to do so without the mental overhead of thinking about which app or which folder or which collection or which method is appropriate to that text, is more refreshing than I expected.</li>
<li>At first I thought the lack of folders or whatever inside Drafts was weird, but now I think I get it; tagging things is fine, if I need to, if I actually make use of it, otherwise, it&rsquo;s just a running log of text things, and this is not the place where they&rsquo;ll ultimately live, if they need to live on—they&rsquo;ll turn into blog posts or emails or Obsidian or Notion docs or whatever they need to, and then eventually out of Drafts. (Or they can just float around in the archive until the end of time. That&rsquo;s fine.)</li>
<li>All of which is to say: I understand now when folks say this is the first app they go to when they have to do some text. Still early to tell if it will be the same for me, but I like the idea of it.</li>
<li>That said I haven&rsquo;t really set up integrations much yet. No posting to micro.blog from here or sending to Obsidian or whatever, mostly because I think I need to pay the subscription fee to be able to edit the steps for those, to make those all work, right? I&rsquo;ll probably wind up paying but if I find out I&rsquo;m not using this in two weeks maybe I actually won&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m getting more into using app-specific system hotkeys in MacOS, so like I have Keysmith installed now so I can do some specific browser stuff, and I&rsquo;ve got a hotkey for iTerm set up, and now I&rsquo;ve got the new Drafts hotkeys, and I kind of wish I had a whole separate row of function keys on my keyboard I could label to all these specific tasks, so I can lose the mental &ldquo;uhm okay hang on option shift what again?&rdquo; baggage.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m wondering what other cool tricks I should know about here. There&rsquo;s a bunch of tips online but I&rsquo;m not sure how much I actually want to make use of yet. (I started drafting a note about &lsquo;ways I use text&quot;&hellip;now I guess I have to remember to update it when I think of other ways I use text.)</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m wondering now if I might actually want to jettison Notion from my life. I don&rsquo;t use it for a lot, I guess, and I guess there&rsquo;s specific ways I do use it; and I guess for sharing purposes I like the feel of it more than Google Docs. That said&hellip;I don&rsquo;t like the &ldquo;HEY HEY HEY USE OUR AI!!!&rdquo; approach they have in place. Because I never want to use AI to write text. And just getting rid of something to make room for this new thing might not be the worst thing in the world to do.</li>
<li>Is there, like, a &ldquo;zen mode&rdquo; here, on the desktop app? I&rsquo;m typing this right now with all the sidebars and menu bars and everything open, and I wonder if there&rsquo;s a key to just hide everything but the note I&rsquo;m writing (without having to manually turn each thing off and on again). I figured out how to create a super minimal experience in Obsidian which is nice for writing; I&rsquo;d like something similar here. (That&rsquo;s not a Workspace thing, is it?)</li>
<li>Okay, I lied: I just added the <a href="https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/2H2">post to Micro.blog</a> extension. If you can read this, I guess it worked!</li>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m midway through the current half-marathon training cycle and it&rsquo;s been kind of a mess! High highs and low lows.</p>
<p>After doing some solid base training leading into the 12 week run-up, I got knocked out by a cold after one run on week one, and missed three runs in a row that week. In the rush to try to catch back up to the plan I think I borderline pushed too hard, which resulted in various leg/knee/ankle pains that all kind of straddled the fence between &ldquo;Eh, you&rsquo;re fine, push through this and you&rsquo;ll be okay!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eh, you should get yourself poured into a body cast and quit running forever, old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve generally opted to push through, with some modifications of the plan along the way, including skipping most of my interval runs, in an effort to try to both keep moving forward while also scaling back in response to what my body was telling me. After playing catch-up week two, I got through weeks three through five alright, capping out at a new-for-me most-miles-in-a-week week. I&rsquo;ve even generally kept up with the tempo runs and race pace runs, which has been nice.</p>
<p>Then last week was another rough miss. I felt okay enough to take a stab at doing an interval run and to my surprise I ran the intervals <em>much</em> faster than I&rsquo;d anticipated. I&rsquo;m not going to lie: it felt pretty awesome. To continue the not-lying: I did not feel pretty awesome the next couple days! I wound up skipping my next two weekday runs in order to let things settle back down, before picking back up with my weekend long run on Saturday, which maybe went better than expected?</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;re on to week seven. I had a tempo run scheduled for last night, but I swapped in an easy run in its place, though my &ldquo;easy&rdquo; pace in this case crept up a bit as the run went on. That said, it generally felt okay, and dare I say it even felt like maybe I was finally feeling like I was having a little fun with running again? I&rsquo;m sure the warmer weather had something to do with that. (First short-sleeves run of the year!) All things going well, this will be my next most-miles-in-a-week week, though, of course, at this point, who knows.</p>
<p>Overall, I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m feeling entirely optimistic, nor can I say I&rsquo;m pessimistic, either, really. What I guess I feel like is someone who isn&rsquo;t quite sure whether he&rsquo;s properly and adequately pushing the limits of what he&rsquo;s capable of, or whether he&rsquo;s being a real big stubborn dumb-dumb because he put some money down on a race experience and he doesn&rsquo;t want to miss out. On the one hand I&rsquo;m telling myself I&rsquo;m not going down without a fight; on the other hand I&rsquo;m wondering if maybe I&rsquo;m losing sight of the forest for the trees. Either way, I&rsquo;m not quitting without a really compelling reason.</p>

If I could line up the right bands I could probably easily do a whole chill month&rsquo;s runs to acts like this.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Warmth</em> by Blondes</strong>. (Remaining a sucker for a good weather album title joke. It was <em>not</em> warm out there that night.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Cosmogramma</em> by Flying Lotus</strong>. (Not my favorite album of his, but felt like the right one to try a run to.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Adam &amp; Eve</em> by Catherine Wheel</strong>. (Okay, so, I&rsquo;m a huge Catherine Wheel fan. Top to bottom, their entire discography, love it, love them, love their music. If they ever got back together I would be torn between selling plasma to get front row seats and wanting nothing to do with it because you shouldn&rsquo;t see your heroes get old and grab cash, right? Right. Anyway! This album has been one of the ones that&rsquo;s most grown on me in the last, uh, let&rsquo;s not count how many years I&rsquo;ve been listening to them now? Anyway: it&rsquo;s a shockingly amazing running album. It&rsquo;s basically an album full of upward-lifting swells, one after the other, and I feel like every time I&rsquo;ve listened to it while running, I&rsquo;ve run a little bit quicker, a little bit lighter, I&rsquo;ve just felt a little <em>better</em>. It&rsquo;s picked me up and carried me a bit further with each pass. And&hellip;now I don&rsquo;t get to listen to it during a run again this year. Boo! Bummer! Whose stupid idea was this plan, anyway/ Anyway. Your mileage may vary. And&hellip;yup, I just killed the &ldquo;your mileage may vary&rdquo; joke in the February list, didn&rsquo;t I? Crud. It&rsquo;s going to be a long year.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Purple</em> by Baroness</strong>. (It was a little cruel, popping this one one, for what was intended to be an easy run. It&rsquo;s also probably not the first choice folks have for favorite Baroness album but I don&rsquo;t even care because this album slams so good.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Screen Violence</em> by Chvrches</strong>. (Trying to parcel out their albums over the year. Not sure I&rsquo;m going to do a great job at it.)</li>
<li><strong><em>A Cricket in Times Square</em> by A Cricket in Times Square</strong>. (A secret classic by a band you&rsquo;ve never heard of. I wish they&rsquo;d stayed together; they should have been huge. That said: this album is amazing.)</li>
<li><strong><em>13 Tales From Urban Bohemia</em> by The Dandy Warhols</strong>. (Good long run album, actually. A little all over the place!)</li>
<li><strong><em>Lobes</em> by We Are Scientists</strong>. (Hey, these guys are still around! And they&rsquo;re still fun. Fun! Also of note: I started downshifting pretty hard this week, ahead of race training. I&rsquo;m questioning that choice today.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Memory</em> by Vivian Girls</strong>. (Easily one of my top 10 bands.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Far</em> by Regina Spektor</strong>. (Is it a weird choice for my favorite Regina Spektor album? I don&rsquo;t know. Don&rsquo;t care. It&rsquo;s wonderful.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Melody’s Echo Chamber</em> by Melody’s Echo Chamber</strong>. (Psychy dreamy rock pop? Yes please.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Detrimentalist</em> by Venetian Snares</strong>. (I was starting to come down with what would be at least a week-long head cold and this album helped me power through my first official training run of race training this cycle, with a 30 minute tempo run. Then everything fell apart&hellip;)</li>
</ol>
<p>Total album count&rsquo;s now at 33 albums, assuming I haven&rsquo;t missed anything. Now we&rsquo;re starting to get into the thing where managing this mess is kind of a weird experience. I&rsquo;m trying to keep my notes app list updated after every run, and I&rsquo;m periodically trying to chuck more albums into the list, because it feels like every time I open the list I&rsquo;m like &ldquo;naw&rdquo; to everything I have slated for potential runs. And just, using a todo list in the notes app is a bit not-quite-right-but-close-enough for this. Anyways.</p>

			 <p>I was doing swell before training started. Thought I had set a nice comfortable base. But, getting knocked out of training on week one after one run by a head cold was&hellip;not great. I got back out there week two, and actually hit all the planned miles on week three, but scrambling back up to this point, where I&rsquo;m not just above my pre-training base, did me no favors. Now I&rsquo;m fighting through some pains that have me thrashing between &ldquo;I should quit. I&rsquo;m being dumb. Ugh.&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay. This is just something to power through. &hellip;Ugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, going forward&hellip;I don&rsquo;t now. I&rsquo;m already off plan so I&rsquo;ve got room to adapt. Like, I missed week two&rsquo;s interval run, and will likely replace tonight&rsquo;s planned intervals with an easy run, which I&rsquo;m sad about because I was looking forward to doing those again, but I feel like it&rsquo;s the smarter choice to keep things easier right now.</p>
<p>My thought is, even if <em>all</em> my runs become easy runs, I&rsquo;d like to try to keep my mileage at or around where the plan would have me, which was still a bit of an ambitious goal, just that in itself. But maybe that&rsquo;s all the stretch I need right now—if I can get to the finish line while letting go of race time goals but also being able to say I just got more miles done during training, that&rsquo;s still something to take with me and feel glad for.</p>
<p>On the flip side, of course, if I need to quit, while it will suck, I will quit. I really don&rsquo;t want to, but, if it&rsquo;s not in the cards, it&rsquo;s not in the cards. Still: I&rsquo;m hoping I don&rsquo;t need to. I think I&rsquo;ll learn a lot from this coming week, which at least in terms of mileage is pretty close to week three; I&rsquo;m swapping out the interval run for an easy run of the same distance, and I&rsquo;m hoping to do my race pace training run Thursday, but that&rsquo;s entirely flexible, too. We&rsquo;ll see what happens as I continue to adjust. One day, one week at a time, right now.</p>

			 <p>Officially kicked off training for my next half marathon last night with a 30 minute tempo run. Considering I was feeling <em>slightly</em> under the weather all day, I wasn&rsquo;t sure I&rsquo;d do the run at all, let alone do it well, and yet&hellip;I pretty much nailed exactly what I set out to do.</p>
<p>My training plan this time out is both more ambitious and a bit more fun, I think. The fun part comes both from increased variety of runs, but also from the fact that—having been through one full training plan so far, having made it to the finish line once, having convinced myself that, yes, I can actually literally do this (even in unexpectedly frigid, un-trained-for weather!), having set a nice base since I got back to consistent running again over the last seven weeks&hellip;I think I can loosen up a bit this time, and focus even more on enjoying the process. Not that I didn&rsquo;t enjoy the process the first time through! I wouldn&rsquo;t have made it to the end if I hadn&rsquo;t, and I still think the process itself, the couple dozen runs that go into it, is more important than that one flashy run at the end. But, like, now, I can enjoy the process of seeing what else I can do, knowing what I&rsquo;ve done already, knowing I&rsquo;ve still got plenty of room to improve, or even just grow. If that makes sense.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m up to four runs a week, over the three runs a week I did in the fall; I&rsquo;ve got a mix of tempo, interval, race pace, and easy/long runs planned. That variety is going to be nice, but also, and I think most importantly, I have very fixed target paces in mind for all these kinds of runs, unlike last time, when I pretty much had no idea what paces to target for anything.</p>
<p>So like for my &ldquo;race pace&rdquo; I&rsquo;m targeting a 2:15 half marathon goal, or 10:17/mile, which, at least right now, feels like a doable stretch. My tempo pace I&rsquo;m basing off a somewhat aspirational 60 minute 10k goal, or 9:39/mile. (I <em>know</em> I have at least one of these in me, but focusing on trying to achieve it in reality hasn&rsquo;t worked out yet.)</p>
<p>For both of these, I&rsquo;ve set my watch to give me a +/- 30 second range on either side of these. I&rsquo;m not good at sticking to specific paces on pure feel, and it just feels like a good idea to have a comfortable amount of wiggle room to play with each time out, hopefully without the watch yelling at me <em>too</em> much. I&rsquo;m also measuring tempo runs in time, not distance, which is interesting, as basically all my runs forever now have been based on distance. Last night I did thirty minutes; I&rsquo;ll get up to 45 at my peak.</p>
<p>On the outer extremes, my slow/easy pace is trying to keep things roughly slower than 11:00/mile, while my interval pace is to try my best to leave <em>Back to the Future</em> Delorean-style flame trails behind me, which should mean down below 9:00/mile. We&rsquo;ll see, though. All my intervals will be quarter mile runs followed by quarter mile light jogs (or even walks), starting at four reps and going up to seven near the end.</p>
<p>So when I say last night went well, to my surprise, I mean my first two miles out I averaged out to within seconds of my 9:39/mile goal pace, and then edged toward about 10 seconds faster for the rest of run time. Considering I was worried about making it into the target range at all, I&rsquo;ll take it!</p>
<p>Still a lot of easy running these first three weeks, with intervals and tempos alternating on Mondays; my long run Saturdays will start at 5 miles, adding a mile each week all the way up to 12. My max mileage weeks should top out at like 28 miles or so around that point, and I&rsquo;ll be consistently above 20 for much of the plan, which is high for me, but I&rsquo;m thinking doable, given a newfound commitment to making those easy runs <em>actually easy</em>. We&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m doing a very silly thing this year, <a href="https://darby3.micro.blog/2023/01/09/184300.html">which I described here</a>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a round-up of the albums I listened to during my runs in January. (I&rsquo;m probably going to figure out a better way to present these lists. Eventually. Maybe!)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>The Physical World</em> by Death From Above 1979</strong>. (Honestly I feel like I should get a re-do on this one since I picked it before I even had any idea what a dumb challenge I was facing this year.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Strange Little Birds</em> by Garbage</strong>. (Garbage&rsquo;s second-act albums have been consistently solid. I don&rsquo;t know why I feel like that surprises me but it does.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Womb</em> by Purity Ring</strong>. (I&rsquo;m new to this band after I think confusing them for some other band I don&rsquo;t want to like. This album is great.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Endure</em> by Special Interest</strong>. (It was a good run.)</li>
<li><strong><em>See Through You</em> by A Place to Bury Strangers</strong>. (I&rsquo;ve lost track of them over the years, since the hayday of blog rock. Tuned back in with this newest album and, gee, it&rsquo;s real good.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Once I Was An Eagle</em> by Laura Marling</strong>. (This was the album I picked when I realized I was really going to have to start spreading my choices out to make it through the year&rsquo;s project. Made for a good chill run. I like all the recurring motifs throughout this album.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Asiatisch</em> by Fatima Al Qadiri</strong>. (While I want to like her music more than I think I actually do, this album did make running through the rain with the lights reflecting off the puddles feel like I was a background character in <em>Bladerunner</em>, and that was pretty great.)</li>
<li><strong><em>The Inheritors</em> by James Holden</strong>. (I thought this would be more fun to run to than it actually was. It&rsquo;s a great album, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, but I think in retrospect it&rsquo;s maybe a bit too electroproggyskronk to make for good running music.)</li>
<li><strong><em>All the Time</em> by Jessy Lanza</strong>. (Summer vibes welcome.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Puberty 2</em> by Mitski</strong>. (I wasn&rsquo;t ready to do intervals yet&hellip;but you kind of can&rsquo;t not do a pseudo-interval or two to the chorus of &ldquo;Best American Girl&rdquo;.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Other Truths</em> by Do Make Say Think</strong>. (I mean, when you can pair a four track album that&rsquo;s forty minutes long to a four mile run&hellip;yeah.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Body Talk</em> by Robyn</strong>. (I felt bad about giving this one up so early in the year but I really needed to take some sunshine on my run.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Reachy Prints</em> by Plaid</strong>. (If you ever have the opportunity to go for a four mile run on a cold winter&rsquo;s night when the snow is still clinging to the tree branches and the world looks like the inside of a fractal and you can pair it with music like Plaid&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s worth it.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Time&rsquo;s Arrow</em> by Ladytron</strong>. (I ran a little too hard to this not-very-hard album. In any case, new Ladytron is always welcome.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Psychic</em> by DARKSIDE</strong>. (Slowed me down, necessarily, nicely, to a neat groove. It&rsquo;s not <em>quite</em> right but it has a certain &ldquo;start of the long race&rdquo; quality—good <em>keep it chill, keep it steady, dummy!</em> music.)</li>
<li><strong><em>This is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About</em> by Modest Mouse</strong>. (It&rsquo;s kind of amazing it took me this long to think of running to this one. There&rsquo;s a nice three-act structure to the album, somewhat perfectly mirroring the warm-up/steady-stride/please-give-me-a-final-stretch-pick-up-and-carry-me-home structure of, at my paces, a seven mile rune. It was kind of perfect for that.)</li>
<li><strong><em>The Big Freeze</em> by Laura Stevenson</strong>. (Laura Stevenson is wonderful. And I&rsquo;m sorry I played this album almost entirely to use its title as a joke about the weather.)</li>
</ol>

			 <p>&hellip;which I am mostly throwing down in writing so I stop second-guessing myself.</p>
<p>I was getting into analysis paralysis over deciding between doing an April half marathon (which would probably have milder weather, but would mean shifting back into training mode like <em>right now oh my god I have to go run 300 miles today</em>) vs a May half marathon (which would give me more time to prepare, but in Cleveland, there&rsquo;s a much higher chance the weather being real gross).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided—or, I am deciding!—to go for the May race. Real hard to imagine running in potential 70-80 degree temperatures in four months! But, this means I can spend the next six weeks focusing on estasblishing a base, which is something I haven&rsquo;t really consciously done in a long time. I&rsquo;ve spent the last year pretty much rising up to races and then recovering from them (sometimes). Getting consistent for a bit feels like the right choice.</p>
<p>Right now I&rsquo;m targeting four easy runs a week, totalling about 16–18 miles, maybe with some mildly faster runs or informal interval experiments to mix things up. That both feels high for me and also probably about right. (I keep reminding myself: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done a half marathon. You probably <em>should</em> be running more than you were when you first started out!&quot;) I&rsquo;ve ramped up to this point a bit quickly the last few weeks, coming out of my December downtime, but now that I&rsquo;m here, I think I can happily linger at this level for a bit.</p>
<p>Once those six weeks are up, and I&rsquo;m hopefully feeling good, I&rsquo;ll shift into a 12 week training plan. I&rsquo;m working on a plan that&rsquo;s a bit more ambitious than I tackled in the fall, complete with actual solid pace goals this time out. Still not planning on breaking any records (ever), but I think I can safely target a race time significantly lower faster than what I did in the fall. Unless of course the heat kills me dead the way the cold killed me dead in November.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://darby3.micro.blog/2023/01/09/184300.html">My Big Dumb Running and Music Challenge of 2023 🎶 🏃</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I track and share <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/15527698">my runs on Strava</a>; on a whim, on my second run this year, I posted, in that run&rsquo;s notes, the album I listened to during the run (<em>Strange Little Birds</em> by Garbage.) I did the same thing for the third run (<em>Womb</em> by Purity Ring) and the fourth run (<em>Endure</em> by Special Interest). Once I figured out what I ran to for the first run of the year (<em>The Physical World</em> by Death From Above 1979) I went back and added that, too.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line, during one of these slow, easy runs, I started wondering: can I go the whole year without listening to the same album twice across any runs?</p>
<p>This is a dumb idea. It probably adds more stress to my life than I need. How am I going to track it? How am I going to pick new stuff if I make it to, like, December, or, heck, June? What happens if I use a favorite album too soon, or ruin it on a bad run? Does this actually result in a cool diary of what my year of running sounds like, or does sharing the fact that I do in fact sometimes listen to Taylor Swift absolutely destroy me in the public eye?</p>
<p>Still, it&rsquo;s the kind of dumb seed of idea that finds fertile ground to develop into a big goofy plant of an idea when I&rsquo;m out running, when I&rsquo;m trying my hardest <em>not</em> to think about anything, and now I&rsquo;m here with a bunch of thoughts and contraints around this absolutely pointless challenge I&rsquo;m now apparently setting out for myself this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll continue sharing the album on Strava, and possibly do monthly or quarterly round-up posts here. Until I forget. And then I won&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>Loophole: if I&rsquo;m craving something truly embarassing, I can redact it from the public records. But, like, as impeccably cool as my first four choices have been, it&rsquo;ll pretty quickly become clear that, like, my music taste is far from impeccably cool.</li>
<li>Once I start the album, that&rsquo;s it, it&rsquo;s on the list. Plenty of runs won&rsquo;t last long enough to cover entire albums. That&rsquo;s fine. Also the album might just not work and I might have to click over to something else mid-run (see loophole below); the album still goes on the list.</li>
<li>Loophole: I&rsquo;m only going to count the first album of any run. So like on long runs if I queue up multiple albums, anything I listen to after album number one doesn&rsquo;t count. I&rsquo;m probably mostly a deliriously unreceptive slate by that point anyway, so it really shouldn&rsquo;t count.</li>
<li>That said, double albums? No two-disc loophole: it&rsquo;s all one album. (So, yes, I&rsquo;ll be saving stuff like <em>The Fragile</em> by Nine Inch Nails for seriously long runs.)</li>
<li>What happens when I&rsquo;m running stays when I&rsquo;m running; anything I listen to outside of running doesn&rsquo;t count. (Having only recently discovered them, I can safely say I&rsquo;m going to listen to that Purity Ring album a couple dozen more times this year.)</li>
<li>Tracking is by album and not artist. There&rsquo;s probably going to be a couple discographies I run through. (No pun intended.)</li>
<li>Throwing a &ldquo;liked tracks&rdquo; list on shuffle is perfectly valid at any point for any reason. And doesn&rsquo;t count against the list.</li>
<li>Same deal for DJ mixes. I have a bucket of these bookmarked on Soundcloud. They&rsquo;re fun. And they won&rsquo;t count.</li>
<li>Loophole: races don&rsquo;t count. Historically I haven&rsquo;t listened to music during races. This year I think I might, and if I do, anything goes; after all, what better time to bring out the big guns?</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny to think about how my relationship to music when I&rsquo;m running has changed over the last 3.5 years, from my original need to carefully soundtrack every single minute of every single run with custom playlists (it was only <em>mildly</em> high-maintenance&hellip;), through to my current of attitude of listening to pretty much literally whatever so long as I like it. Not that I don&rsquo;t still generally prefer more upbeat stuff when I go out; it&rsquo;s unlikely I&rsquo;m about to go out running to <em>Selected Ambient Works Volume II</em> by Aphex Twin anytime soon. But &ldquo;upbeat&rdquo;, it seems, can take on a lot of forms, when you have zero thoughts about pace matching or anything like that. (I&rsquo;d be pretty curious to see what a two-hour run to Autechre&rsquo;s NTS Session 4 would do to one&rsquo;s headspace.)</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m planning on running a full marathon in 2024.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been planning for this since I started training for the half marathon I just ran. I looked at the half marathon as a chance to dip my toe in the distance-running water to see whether I liked the feel for this kind of training or whether it felt like too much. So far, so good: nothing about the half marathon cycle I just went through made me want to give up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, because even with what I&rsquo;ve done, I still feel like I have a little imposter syndrome, when it comes to running. I still feel very conservative in my approach, using the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; still kind of makes me want to break out in hives, and I come into this knowing that running a full marathon isn&rsquo;t some huge life-long dream of mine. (For that, you&rsquo;d have to look at biking. While I&rsquo;ve biked one metric century, I still feel like I&rsquo;ve got at least one full 100 mile ride in me. Some day.) I started running three years ago in order to support a particular charity 5k, and with two kids in the house I was looking for a form of exercise that was a bit more effective than bicycling (which long rides, when I was training for that metric century, took me out of the house <em>forrrevvvver</em>), and because I generally thought it would be cool to be able to run a full mile without stopping. After a couple rocky years I got more consistent with running last year and started wondering if I could run a marathon.</p>
<p>And I started to think that maybe I could. And I started to think that maybe if I thought I could, if I even had an inkling of interest in it, maybe I should do something about it sooner rather than later, because while I&rsquo;m not old, I&rsquo;m certainly not getting any younger. At one point I thought about just going straight for it in 2023 but then decided I&rsquo;m just not that hardcore. So I came up with a loose plan to give myself well over a year to build up to it while also giving myself plenty of freedom to back out at any time for any reason with no penalty.</p>
<p>And now here I am, my first half marathon in the books, and as of right now, that big-picture goal still seems reasonable. I mean, it seems crazy, but also possible. Nothing about this process the last few months made me want to quit. Whether or not I actually make it all the way I feel like I&rsquo;m having fun right now, like I&rsquo;m building up a sustainable running practice, and I&rsquo;m learning a lot about what motivates me to keep going, and of which is worth it.</p>
<p>And I can still run <em>one whole mile</em> without stopping. And that still does feel pretty cool!</p>
<p>That said, I&rsquo;ve learned a bit about how goal motivated I am. Races—as much as I anguish over them—bring structure and focus to all the runs that come before them. So I&rsquo;m going to keep doing them, and I&rsquo;m planning on doing two more half-marathons in 2023. I want to re-run the Fall Classic in November, because I want to have at least one year-over-year apples-to-apples comparison, just to see what there is to see. Before that I want to try for a late spring race, I think, because I&rsquo;d like to run at least one of these races in (hopefully) nice weather. I&rsquo;ve earned that!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also ready to care about pace a little more. Admittedly, I ran the November race slow enough that it would be tough <em>not</em> to beat that time next time out, after another round of training, but also I just <em>know</em> I can go faster than that, and I want to specifically try for that. I never expect to be competitive at these things, nor am I interested in trying hard enough to be. But I also know it&rsquo;s fun to surprise yourself, and I can get behind trying hard enough for that. So I&rsquo;m setting out with the loose goal this spring of beating my first time, and then going for something reasonably ambitious in the fall.</p>
<p>To that end, in the short term, I want to run more during the next training cycle. Not necessarily harder, but more. I know I trained at about the barest possible minimal level for the fall race. Next time out I want to go from three days a week to four. I think I&rsquo;m going to repeat the same basic 12-week training calendar as the last time out, which I liked the general feel of, with the addition of the fourth day, which would be a shorter, light/easy day. I have no plans to target five days as I want to keep a day or two free for an elliptical session or finding a strength training or yoga habit I like.</p>
<p>While I said I don&rsquo;t necessarily want to run harder, I do generally want to bring my paces up across the board. Sometimes these last few months I felt fine, sometimes I felt like I had more to give but was holding back. I&rsquo;m still not quite sure what easy <em>should</em> actually feel like but I think just in general the more I run the more efficient I get and if I can maintain my consistency through into the new year I&rsquo;ll naturally feel a little more okay going a little more fast a little more often. Maybe more importantly though, for confidence purposes, I want to push my race pace experiments more aggressively. I want to pick an ambitious target early and stick with it the whole way through. I really wasn&rsquo;t sure what felt right this last time through, and now I think I want to use those runs to push myself to give a little more. Still, even if it&rsquo;s nothing like what I run on race day, having those faster days in the training cycle feels fun.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also hoping to do some shorter races that I can really try for my best-possible paces. I&rsquo;m thinking about re-doing the 10k I ran last spring, which left me feeling like I had something unresolved there that I&rsquo;d like to make good on. I&rsquo;m also curious to see if I can beat my summer 5k race&rsquo;s time from last year, too. Which actually feels like it could be the most ambitious goal of the year! If I find some 10k races that fit in with the half marathon plans, I might try to slide those in, too, for practice purposes, but I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s going to work out or not.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s the year in a nutshell, as I picture it right now: a half, some shorter stuff, and then a give-it-my-all half by the year&rsquo;s end. Working on confidence, pace, and strength. And then all going well, launching into full marathon training come January 2024.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Monday afternoon, about 24 hours after I crossed the finish line, is when I finally started to believe that I&rsquo;d just run my first half marathon. I felt pretty spaced out before that, like I&rsquo;d been walking through a post-race cloud, and it was only when I started to come out of it that I felt like I could not just know I did it as a fact but feel that I did it as a truth. If that makes sense. Like I could feel the nervous energy start to dissipate into a sense of accomplishment. It made for a nice post-race high.</p>
<p>That said: oh my lord, I have never before felt <em>cold</em> like I did right after that race.</p>
<p>To back up a bit: the week before the race I continued my taper. It got a little weird! I&rsquo;d planned on Tuesday/Thursday runs like usual with super-easy Monday/Friday elliptical sessions, all basically just to keep loose while resting up. Monday went fine, then Tuesday fell apart for various reasons, including truly miserable weather, and I wound up cancelling. So then I went back out for a handful of miles Wednesday night, a few at &ldquo;race pace,&rdquo; then had to turn around and get up early on Friday to get one more run in before work and the weekend. It all worked out fine, and my fears of over-sleeping Friday came to nothing, but the whole stutter-step of a final week&rsquo;s schedule was <em>slightly</em> nerve-wracking.</p>
<p>I felt good Friday, and slept like a baby that night, which was nice, because I knew I&rsquo;d probably <em>not</em> sleep like a baby the night before the race. (Spoiler alert: I did not sleep good Saturday night.) Saturday felt like one of the longest days of my life. I&rsquo;m learning just how susceptible I am to pre-race nerves. I know it&rsquo;s healthy to a degree, the body&rsquo;s way of getting amped up for the coming event. But I also think I was tipping a bit past &ldquo;excitement&rdquo; and more into &ldquo;bro, you <em>must chill</em>&rdquo; territory. I did not enjoy myself much that day. Again, everything worked out! But I know I want to work out a better day-before strategy for the future.</p>
<p>Leading up to race day I was watching the weather forecast. Specifically, I was watching the forecasted temperature drop like a rock. Signing up for a late November race in northeast Ohio, I have some idea what I&rsquo;m getting myself into. But! Yikes! Based on my experience at the 5k at the same event last year, I was happily anticipating low-40s, gray clouds, maybe some fog. You know&hellip;perfect running weather. I was not prepared for the low 20s. With a wind chill that took it down to single-digit territory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How cold was it,&rdquo; you ask? Could enough that I&rsquo;d never adequately had the chance to test race day gear—I&rsquo;d run in three layers of clothing earlier that week, but decided at the last minute to throw on a fourth vest layer on top on my running fleece layer. Cold enough that every time I thought I was warmed up enough during the run that I could unzip those top two layers to vent, I was zipping back up within minutes. Cold enough that the water they were giving out on the course was actually freezing—at least, there were definitely ice chips in mine. Cold enough that a friend of mine said her water pack vest froze up on her, so she couldn&rsquo;t use it during the race. Like, this was not fun running cold. This was <em>real</em> cold. Did I need to score those extra bad-ass points my first time out? No. Did I, though? I guess so!</p>
<p>The good news is the snow that hit near my house up by the lake was a non-issue to the south, and we got some beautiful (if heatless) sun for the entirety of the race, too. Good for keeping spirits up, at least. And yet, still, it was <em>cold</em> cold.</p>
<p>As for how I did: I did it. If you&rsquo;ve been following along you know my one goal going into the run was to run the whole way and&hellip;I did that. I ran the whole way. I took full advantage of my &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about pace this time out&rdquo; mindset. My pace was way at the slowest end of my anticipated range, but I still came in just ahead of my &ldquo;Something probably went wrong&rdquo; time. I&rsquo;ll take it! I definitely went very conservative on pacing, as thoughts of burning out early were strong. And of course the weather this fall was way too kind, affording no appropriate lead-in down to race-day temperatures.</p>
<p>All that said, there really were some nice stretches in the middle where the miles did kind of melt into each other. Five through eight, maybe? Things did get uglier as I went on, though. While I knew for a fact I could do it, I still felt like I had to dig in a bit to convince myself that I was <em>going</em> to do it. That it was going to be <em>way</em> more fun to be able to tell everyone afterward that I did in fact make it. That working for the hard thing, and then achieving it, was exactly the kind of example I wanted to set for my two kids. That if I stopped running, it was going to be a real cold walk back to the finish line&hellip;</p>
<p>The course was nice—an out-and-back double-loop along the Cleveland Metroparks parkway drive. Quiet; I did in fact run without music, to prove to myself I could, and without getting into future plans yet, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m going to feel the need to do that again! Not much in the way of spectators, of course, because of the weather and because of where the course was run. It was fun to see all the fast people running back the other way several times over from my back-of-the-pack vantage point. Huge props to all the volunteers along the course. Every kind word was incredible.</p>
<p>Crossing the finish line, which I finally actually really believed I was going to do once I finally caught sight of it, wasn&rsquo;t exactly anti-climactic, but it also wasn&rsquo;t really accompanied by an orchestral swell, either—that feeling, as I said above, really didn&rsquo;t come until 24 hours later. Crossing the finish line mostly meant <em>oh my god wow I can stop running now</em>. Which felt really nice for a while. Until the cold settled in. Which I knew to anticipate, but, like, I couldn&rsquo;t <em>really</em> anticipate what standing in freezing temperatures in four sweaty layers was actually going to feel like. Suffice it to say I did not finish my post-race beer—though no cold was going to stop me from having at least a few victory chugs—before I went home, showered with all the hot water in the house, and then collapsed under multiple blankets for a few hours, until my body finally felt <em>almost</em> warm again.</p>
<p>And thus concludes my first half-marathon training cycle, which was as much about the journey as the destination. It&rsquo;s been a week and I&rsquo;m feeling surprisingly good. I was concerned about post-race blues, but knock on wood, so far my spirits have stayed up—landing the race right before a busy holiday week probably helped with that. And knowing even before going into the race that it was always going to be part of a bigger picture, with some next steps already tentatively laid out, certainly hasn&rsquo;t hurt. For now, though, I&rsquo;ve been out for a couple short, light recovery runs, and I&rsquo;m feeling okay, and I think it&rsquo;s going to be nice to just run for fun with no training expectations for a little while, which I haven&rsquo;t actually done since&hellip;April, I think? What a wild year it has been&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Taper week! Ran four easy miles on Tuesday, four miles on Thursday with two of those at race pace, and five miles on Saturday, my shortest long run since week two. If I was bemoaning the lack of seasonably appropriate training weather the last few weeks, well, Saturday&rsquo;s run threw a big bucket of cold drizzly slushy nonsense right in my face. Felt good to have at least one proper day for testing out possible race day clothing, I suppose?</p>
<p>I knew going into the week I was ready for this taper time, and while I don&rsquo;t have anything extremely specific to point at to confirm this, I can say I do feel like I&rsquo;m&hellip;actively recharging. Like I can now not just know but also <em>feel</em> the fact that I&rsquo;ve made real gains the last few months. If running week ten&rsquo;s total of 22.5 miles was a stretch and a challenge, one I felt proud to meet, running this week&rsquo;s total of 13 miles left me feeling like my body knew it had more to give. And I&rsquo;m both nervous and excited about tapping into that feeling this coming weekend. (How unfair is it, by the way, that it&rsquo;s when you have the most nervous energy, that you least get to do the thing that helps you vent that energy?)</p>
<p>All of which&hellip;brings us to this coming Sunday. My goal for the race remains as clear as it has been since the start—get to the finish line without walking breaks. I know for a fact now that I can make it twelve miles—when I&rsquo;m pretty well under-rested, at that!—and I think I can reasonably trust that a mix of adrenaline and pure stubbornness will get me past the last 1.1 miles. I&rsquo;m feeling generally confident about this.</p>
<p>The strategy to get to that point feels like it&rsquo;s all about how I start the race. That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve got some mental baggage I need to shed: the first time I did a 5k and the one time I&rsquo;ve done a 10k, adrenaline and nerves pushed me out too hot, which killed me later in the run. I started training for this race assuming there&rsquo;s a good chance I&rsquo;d make similar mistakes&hellip;but now that I&rsquo;ve gotten to this point, I really, obviously don&rsquo;t want to! So I&rsquo;m hoping to learn from my past and to manage my nerves as I wait for the start, and to keep things real conservative and chill for as long as feels right. I&rsquo;ve been trying to listen to my body during my long runs, and I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out when and how to ease up before reaching that red-line zone, without needing to come to a stop. If I feel good toward the middle of the race I know I can loosen up a bit more, and I hope there&rsquo;s a point toward the end when I can stop holding back and just <em>go</em>, because that sounds like it would be really, really fun&hellip;but to get to those points I need to avoid frying myself too early.</p>
<p>Part of all this is reminding myself that I don&rsquo;t have a time goal this time out. I have a general idea where I &ldquo;should&rdquo; fall but I&rsquo;m choosing not to make that my concern this time. In large part because, well&hellip;like, this whole process has been an education and a trial, and as part of that, pace has been generally mysterious to me, anyways. Like: Saturday&rsquo;s miles <em>felt</em> easy, but turned out to be a bit on the quick side of my recent range, but not quite at the race pace I&rsquo;ve been practicing at (without any real intent of actually meeting on race day!). It felt really good; does it feel like the kind of easy-fast I can keep for a half-marathon? No idea! At this point I can happily admit I&rsquo;ve never had a good sense these last few months of what my pace zones should feel like. Whatever does happen Sunday I know I&rsquo;ve made obvious gains that I think I can have fun playing around with going forward.</p>
<p>Which, yes, I have a lot of thoughts already about the <em>going forward</em> part. Which I am trying hard to keep on a shelf for the moment. Because for now I&rsquo;ve got a couple more taper runs to get through and then <a href="https://www.clewestrunningclub.org/fall-classic.html#/">it&rsquo;s time to go do the thing</a>. (Okay, maybe I can go ahead and visualize going forward, a little bit&hellip;specifically, going forward from the finish line to the beer garden?&hellip;)</p>

			 <p>AKA…peak week!</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: I made it!</p>
<p>Tuesday was 4.5 miles, easy, down from last week’s five. I’ve been letting these “easy” runs get away from me, so, knowing this week‘s other two runs were going to be intense in their own ways, I consciously kept this one light. The kind of light that feels comical. Like, <em>am</em> I even running? I think I was successful. Kept my pace slow-for-me and heart rate down, and felt pretty good at the end. It’s a bit late in the game to reconnect with this kind of run for this training cycle, though it will come in handy during tapering, for sure. And it will be worth focusing on after the race, too.</p>
<p>Thursday’s race pace run added a full mile, taking me up to four miles of pace (plus warm up and cool down miles). I kept that pace right around where I’d kept it the week before, with relatively few “Slow down, dummy!” alerts from my watch, all the way through the fourth mile. It felt really good and also <em>oh gee</em> did I feel it afterward, all the way through Friday. (It wasn’t exactly concerning so much as I felt generally beat up. Like I’ve been training for ten solid weeks to run my first half-marathon, or something. I imagine it would be weirder if I were still feeling extra fresh right now, right?) These pace runs have remained fun, though they still feel a bit aspirational. I’m not planning to actively seek that pace during this race, but maybe I’ve laid some good groundwork for future races.</p>
<p>Then came Saturday’s twelve miler, a big jump from last week’s ten. My dream of the perfectly restorative night’s sleep didn’t pan out, and while I felt somewhat better this morning, I know I wasn’t back to one hundred percent, either. So I’m not surprised my average pace was slower than my last few long runs…but I <em>am</em> actually pleasantly surprised that I made it all twelve miles. (Those miles past ten are real big Life Choices, aren’t they?)</p>
<p>I set my watch to alert me every three miles, which felt right; it wasn’t a twelve mile run, it wasn’t a run two miles longer than my last long run, it was just four three mile runs, back to back! For that first three miles I felt tight, like the whole thing was going to be too much <em>work</em>, and I was a little certain I was going to bag the whole thing by the halfway point. But…once I got into sections two and three, I loosened up, and it really didn’t feel so bad for a while. Until I got into the last segment, when my body was really starting to complain. Still, even then, that last bit of adrenaline pumped in, and I pulled off a nice final kick. Not my fastest stretch ever, but boy oh boy did realizing <em>I was still doing the thing</em> feel amazing.</p>
<p>Which, again, just doing the thing is about all I’m looking for this time out, come race day. Race day, which is now two weeks away, on the other side of some <em>sweet, sweet, sweet</em> tapering. Oh, yes, I am looking forward to tapering. The rest is going to be nice. As will be not waking up approximately a million hours before dawn next Saturday!</p>

			 <p>When I started writing up these weekly summaries, I wanted to document the downs as much as the ups, and based on my experience training for the 5k in July, I honestly thought there’d be more dramatic downs. Missed runs, weird injuries, crummy weeks. Knock on wood, there hasn’t been much of any of that. There’s minor things, weird things I’m maybe not getting into much, in the interest of keeping these updates somewhat brief, or maybe because I’m doing a bad job of writing down as much as I actually should. But…while I would never describe this process as <em>easy</em>, I‘m also really surprised—and, of course, pleased—at how generally smooth things have been going.</p>
<p>Case in point: after the slightly weird, mildly narratively interesting week that was week eight, week nine felt…pretty fine! Essentially uneventful! Except of course not exactly uneventful because I ran 20 miles this week for the second time ever, which is certainly an <em>event</em>. But it also kind of just happened, which is nice.</p>
<p>Five of those miles came from my easy run on Tuesday, which became an unintentional race pace kind of run for a bit, because I kind of just felt good and the weather kind of just felt perfect and I kind of just went faster than I meant to. It did not suck.</p>
<p>Another five miles came from my actual race pace run on Thursday. In an effort to avoid the “I’m going to go <em>extra</em> sort of fast for the last stretch” thing I’ve been doing the last few weeks, I set my watch to just notify me when the three race pace miles were done, rather than notifying me at each mile. That helped, I think. I mean, it made the race pace segment feel very long, but it stayed pretty steady, which felt nice.</p>
<p>And then of course ten miles came on Saturday morning, which had me out the door before sunrise. I kept the route generally more flat than the previous time I went out for ten miles. It felt long, but it also felt pretty good; certainly better than the week previous. I definitely felt like I needed to push myself to finish, a bit, near the end—ten miles really is so many miles! I think it showed up in my pace graph; my first three miles were on my slower side, but then my last three miles were pretty fast, the last two actually edging into my hypothetical race pace range. All in, where my last three long runs all hit the exact same average pace, this one landed the average at exactly two seconds faster. I’ll take it!</p>
<p>I know, intuitively, that running can be as much a mental game as a physical one. That said, it has long been hard to imagine ever reaching the point where a run could get long enough to become kind of boring. While I’m not exactly there yet, I feel like I can see that territory around me, now, on some of these runs. I’m starting to consciously play with that a bit.</p>
<p>So like, for this long run, instead of having my watch buzz me after every mile, I had it buzz me after every 2.5 miles, to see what it feels like when I thought of the run less as being a collection of ten miles and more as four longer segments. I’m not sure how much of a difference it made, until near the end, when that last segment started, and it felt like, somewhat irrationally, it was going to be <em>so much longer than all the others</em>.</p>
<p>More dramatically, I also took this long run without music. Though I run with music all the time—a subject worth its own post—I’ll leave the headphones behind on race day. It’s not that I’m worried anyone’s going to think I’m tempo matching or anything—I’m clearly too slow for that to even matter! It’s more out of, in part, wanting to keep my situational awareness levels up, as I never run with others around me, and also, in part, because letting in spectator noise, picking up that energy, feels really cool; in the shorter races I’ve done, it’s a huge part of what’s made the actual race feel like a real thing. Still, thirteen (point one!) miles is a long time to run without one of my primary crutches, and I wanted to take at least one test run ahead of time without music to make sure I actually could do it. Confirmed: I can actually do it! At least, I can for ten miles. I’ll have to trust race day adrenaline will keep me going for the last three, though, because I’m definitely soundtracking next week’s twelve miler. It’s just way more fun that way.</p>
<p>Three more weeks to go.</p>

			 <p>I was in a weird headspace this week. Nothing calamitous, just enough to feel slightly <em>off</em>. Despite two of my three runs going longer, it was still technically a lighter week in terms of total mileage, so I guess if there was a week to feel a bit off, this was the one.</p>
<p>My Tuesday evening easy run went up to 4.5 miles. After several failed attempts to run early to avoid rain, I wound up running at my usual time…in the rain. It was fine. Fairly light. Cold, though. I&rsquo;m glad I invested earlier this year in a good rain jacket for running.</p>
<p>Thursday took me out for five miles, three playing with race pace. I kept a pleasant pace for the first two then pushed it for number three, going fast-for-me and definitely outside my distance-run comfort zone. Fun to go past the point of sustainability, though I really do want to convince myself to keep it in check the next couple weeks. I think there&rsquo;s a sweet spot in there somewhere. Not sure I&rsquo;m going to feel comfortable trying for it this coming race, because really still all I want to do is get to that finish line in one piece. But, again, fun to play. And maybe lay groundwork for mnore ambitious (yet still hypothetical) future attempts.</p>
<p>Saturday&rsquo;s long run was eight miles. Ignoring the fact that I only actually just ran eight for the first time ever three weeks earlier, I took a slightly-too-nonchalant attitude toward this run, because it was technically less than the previous week&rsquo;s ten miles. Eight, after doing ten? Ought to be a breeze, right? So after three morning long runs I went back to my usual afternoon slot, after spending the morning out with my family, putting in at least a mile of photography-and-kids-chasing time around Metroparks trails. Then I had a heavy lunch, much heavier than the lighter &ldquo;let&rsquo;s see what might actually work on race day&rdquo; breakfasts I&rsquo;ve been trying out. Oh, and it was like 30 degrees warmer outside than either of my weekday runs from this week.</p>
<p>Long story short, this run felt ugly. But! My average pace exactly matched that from the previous two long runs. Three long runs in a row with the exact same average pace is weird, right?</p>
<p>So, glad I got it done, grateful for the educational experience, but I&rsquo;m also happy to put this week behind me. Feels like one to shake off, like a good time to take a deep breath and recenter. The next two weeks are doozies for me, at 20 and 22.5 miles, respectively. I&rsquo;ll definitely be trying to get back out in the morning for those long runs.</p>
<p>Four weeks until race day! Four weeks until race day? Four weeks until race day&hellip;</p>

			 <p>I live in Lakewood, a fairly dense city directly to the west of Cleveland. I work forty minutes outside Cleveland, in Oberlin, which is surrounded by farmland. I used to run down there a lot back in 2019, when I first started running, doing my couch-to-5k program. Then, something happened, in 2020, and I didn&rsquo;t run down there much? I&rsquo;m not sure, the timeline gets a little blurry&hellip;</p>
<p>In any case, I&rsquo;ve been craving some fresh scenery, so I finally remembered to pack my stuff and take it with me this past week, so I could do my weekday runs out of the office. It felt weird! I guess I have a lot of place-memory/sense-memory of struggle-running down there, of thinking three miles was <em>so flipping far</em>, and coming into this week, I had a weird amount of pointless nervous energy built up, like I was going to immediately fall on my face as soon as I started, or something.</p>
<p>For Tuesday I did a specific four mile loop that I&rsquo;d eyed up as a <em>big crazy stretch goal</em> route back in 2019. It felt so ambitious, back then. Little did I imagine when I&rsquo;d finally run it it would be totally chill weekday training. Training for a run more than three times longer than that one. No big deal. (Basically. I actually went maybe one notch harder than I probably should have. I blame coming off the extra rest day as my schedule slid back to normal; I felt a little coiled up, going into it. Went okay, in any event, so it&rsquo;s cool.)</p>
<p>With most of my running happening in urban areas, it was fun to add some corn into the mix.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Thursday had me going 4.5 miles, with 2.5 at &ldquo;race&rdquo; pace. I successfully kept the race pace slower by about 30 seconds for the first two miles (before I kicked it up a bit for the last half mile, because why not) from where I&rsquo;d been the week before, when I&rsquo;d felt I&rsquo;d been going a bit too hard for something sustainable. This felt really good. This felt like the fun kind of tempo run/threshold run/&ldquo;this feels like a good workout&rdquo; run I remember from 5k training in the summer. Faster, for me, without feeling like I was punishing myself. It&rsquo;s a really fun run to include in the weekly mix. (I <em>kind of</em> miss interval running, but I <em>definitely</em> missed these tempo runs.) Still probably not a realistic pace for the whole race, but maybe something I could reach for on the back third, when the final puddle of adrenaline has nowhere else to go?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s this week&rsquo;s huge milestone: my first 10 mile run.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I tried to spin this into a coherent narrative, but really I just have lots of random thoughts and observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>I made it! Wow!</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not to say that my first nine and my first eight mile runs weren’t huge milestones, but something about crossing over into double-digit territory feels significant.</li>
<li>Wildly&hellip;ten felt easier than nine. There&rsquo;s a lot of reasons why that could be. I’ve been adding a mile to the long run each week for seven straight weeks now, and maybe finally my body was just like, “Oh, okay, yup, this is what we do, now.&quot; Maybe there was a little extra adrenaline kick from going to ten. Maybe it was the route, or the time of day, or the breeze hit just right, or something I ate. Maybe I actually stayed in bed and dreamed the whole run? I don&rsquo;t know. I am not complaining.</li>
<li>I am decidedly <em>not</em> a morning person. I do most of my running at night or in the afternoon, partially because of life scheduling and partially because <em>I am decidedly not a morning person</em>. Because of scheduling I had to get up for this one at 5:30 AM, though, like some kind of &ldquo;real&rdquo; runner. I was nervous about that, both about actually responding to the alarm that early and then about my body actually <em>doing</em> the thing, which I&rsquo;ve historically had some issues with. But clearly everything worked out.</li>
<li>I ran ten miles. <em>Ten miles</em>.</li>
<li>The ascending pace graph wasn&rsquo;t as picture-perfect as the nine miler from the week before, but it was still very, very pretty, and when you average it out to 2.5 mile splits, it looked even nicer. I like this because it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;m explicitly trying for, and it&rsquo;s nice to feel like my body is kind of doing something &ldquo;right&rdquo; without me having to force it. It felt natural, I guess.</li>
<li>I explored a lot of options for the route, then just wound up&hellip;going. Which was fun. My city&rsquo;s about 6-ish square miles of city blocks, and I live pretty close to smack dab in the center of it, and it turns out it&rsquo;s pretty easy to wind up and down and around to get the miles in without too much planning, so long as you&rsquo;re vaguely aware of how far from home you&rsquo;ve gotten. (I like trying to know about where I&rsquo;m going to end a run; visualizing a finish line keeps me going.)</li>
<li>I wound up doing a lot of north-south back-and-forth, which is fun, because when you go south, away from the lake, you can get <em>a bit</em> of an upward climb, and then when you head back north, you can get <em>a bit</em> of a descent. Not much! Not even close to much! Ohio&rsquo;s pretty flat around where I&rsquo;m at. But literally any climbing is more climbing than no climbing. Just having that little bit of variance in the route helps keep things interesting. All told I think it added up to about three times more &ldquo;climbing&rdquo; than the half-marathon route will entail. I probably actually need to consciously make sure my long runs are more flat just to make sure that&rsquo;s not a big factor come race day.</li>
<li>Did I mention the part where I ran for <em>ten miles</em>?</li>
<li>Up to this run I&rsquo;ve generally felt okay about this project—like the half-marathon goal is possible, but still kind of a huge abstraction, something I&rsquo;m working toward, but who knows if I&rsquo;ll actually make it. With this run I finally felt like, yeah, okay: I&rsquo;ve got this. Not that I&rsquo;m going to get cocky or anything, there&rsquo;s still a lot miles between me and the finish line, but I actually definitely mostly sort of kind of feel like I&rsquo;m probably certainly maybe going to make it. Potentially! Which is a cool feeling.</li>
</ul>
<p>This coming week brings a relative breather—my two weekday runs both go up by half a mile but my weekend run drops back to eight, the first time my weekend run goes shorter since I began the training plan. (&ldquo;Shorter&rdquo; in this case meaning &ldquo;will qualify as one of my four longest runs ever to date.&quot;) So I lose a mile this week but then the following two weeks pack on multiple extra miles ahead of the taper week. Those two weeks will probably put my whole good-vibes feeling to the test, I suspect.</p>

			 <p>Okay! Week six! The build continues, with a nine mile run following last week’s eight miler. And it went swimmingly: without really trying, I managed to create the most beautiful pace graph ever, with every mile either at or a bit above the pace of the previous mile, right on through to the end. Even past the point around the start of mile seven when I started having mild doubts about whether or not I was even going to make it to the end. Cardiovascularly I was feeling pretty good, and my energy level was okay, though I was definitely <em>feeling</em> it—the basic endurance required to just keep going for that long is truly something else…but oh gosh did my legs feel like I was trying to run nine miles for the first time a week after running eight miles for the first time. Not horrible, but not exactly strain-free, either! It’s possible there was some internal motivational screaming happening during mile eight. It’s possible there was some <em>audible</em> motivational screaming happening in mile nine. Possibly! Maybe! It’s fine. I’m fine and definitely not crazy or weird.</p>
<p>We’re at the point here near Cleveland where the temperature is starting to drop, which makes me start thinking really hard about <em>hey wait how the heck do I dress for these conditions again</em>? I’ve been through enough of these cycles now that I’m going into this fall season knowing well that I just run hot, in general, doubly so when I’m actually running, and that whatever other people might be wearing, I’m going to be better off wearing <em>less</em> than what my rational mind tells me to wear. For today’s low-fifties-and-overcast run, that meant skipping the extra layers I was starting to think I should start thinking about piling on. Though I did upgrade from a thin running shirt to a merino running shirt! Short sleeves, though! Felt good, and once I warmed up a bit, it took stronger gusts to remind me that, hey, it was actually kind of chilly out there. But yeah, it’s probably time to think about pulling out the extra stuff.</p>
<p>The easy four miler on Monday was…an easy four miles. I ran a weird route because I’ve got this side thing going where I’m trying to run so that my heat map on Strava eventually indicates that I’ve run every single street in Lakewood. Picked up a couple streets that I’d somehow skipped over to date. It’s a silly project but a fun way to force me to mix up my routes a bit, now and then. (There’s going to be some really weird runs in my future dedicated to logging time on weird little tiny side streets.)</p>
<p>My pace race run on Wednesday, I was up to two miles of race pace running, for which I’d slid my target pace another thirty seconds faster from the week previous, and I landed both miles pretty close to the fastest end of that minute. And…yeah, I think it’s time to try to figure out how to consciously slide my pace back into the slower half of that minute. I think what I’m looking for is a pace where it feels like I’m running fast but not hard; the race pace portion of Wednesday’s run was fast, for me, but probably a bit too hard, for a sustainable long-distance effort. Or at least, I don’t feel compelled to try to maintain that pace for that long, not yet, not at this stage. I’m just not quite sure that I know how to fine-tune my pace to such a degree, yet, though I guess actually consciously trying to will be a good start!</p>
<p>Which all brings me to the exact halfway point of this half-marathon training plan. At least in terms of weeks—there’s a <em>lot</em> of miles to cover yet! Right now, today, eight hours after I finished my long run, I’m feeling pretty good about all this. I feel like, so long as I can keep my motivation up, I’m still on track to make it to that half-marathon finish line in something resembling one piece. Knock on wood, fingers crossed, all that good stuff….</p>

			 <p>Throwing a couple bookmarklet code samples up here for reference.</p>
<p>These stemmed from <a href="https://micro.blog/amit/13460628">this conversation thread</a> which finally got me thinking about a couple super simple bookmarklets I could add for my own convenience. Add these as bookmarks to the browser toolbar, and click them as needed to filter out posts. They&rsquo;re not feature-rich, they&rsquo;re one-way only (i.e., to un-hide posts, you need to refresh the page!), and they&rsquo;re only tested (barely) in Firefox, so anyone else&rsquo;s mileage may vary.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a JS bookmarklet for hiding MB posts from the <a href="https://micro.blog">https://micro.blog</a> timeline based on length. The &ldquo;25&rdquo; in the middle is a character count—that can be manually fine-tuned by changing the number, to hide various lengths of posts. Because sometimes there&rsquo;s lots of tiny short posts that fill up the timeline, and this is a way to quickly hide them, for convenience.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>javascript: (() =&gt; { document.querySelectorAll('.post').forEach(post =&gt; {   const text = post.querySelector('.post_text');   if (text.innerText.length &lt; 25 ) {     post.style.display = &quot;none&quot;;   } })})()
</code></pre><p>Here&rsquo;s a JS bookmarklet for hiding MB @ mention posts from the the <a href="https://micro.blog">https://micro.blog</a> timeline. It&rsquo;s just looking for an &lsquo;@&rsquo; at the start of the post, and if it finds it, it hides the post. Because sometimes you want to see mentions because they lead to interesting conversations you wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise discovered, and other times you just want to filter them out so you can see top-level posts by themselves.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>javascript: (() =&gt; { document.querySelectorAll('.post').forEach(post =&gt; {      const text = post.querySelector('.post_text');   if (text.innerText[0] === '@' ) {     post.style.display = &quot;none&quot;;   } })})()

			 <p>For my second race pace run, this Wednesday, I’d set my target pace range minute 30 seconds faster than the prior week’s target, based on the earlier week&rsquo;s pace. Then I did the first mile 15 seconds faster than that. And the following half mile at a 45 seconds faster pace. Which felt amazing but also <em>whaaaaat</em>? I don&rsquo;t know. Either my body is telling me something my mind doesn&rsquo;t know what to do with, or my mind hasn&rsquo;t clearly communicated the <em>real</em> plan to my body yet. So I&rsquo;m kind of torn. I could try to let it rip like this for as long as I can, because after all, I clearly have no idea what my pace ranges actually are or should be, and seeing how far I can push these paces is definitely educational. On the flip side I could try to reign it back in, and try harder to target something closer to my easy run paces—faster, still, but not <em>that</em> much faster, so I gain a better sense of what an ambitious, but also realistic, pace feels like. I think I&rsquo;m going to just roll with it for another week before trying to course-correct just yet. If nothing else, it does feel really good to have this kind of fast-for-me run in the mix.</p>
<p>Did my long run on Friday. 8 miles. My new longest run ever! Felt good! Felt long! Can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m going to turn back around and go 9 miles this coming week! For as weirdly anxious as I was going into the run, my pace felt good, generally in the lower half of my original minute target range; I slowed down a bit around mile six, which, coincidentally, I&rsquo;m sure, was the one part of the run with something resembling actual climb. Then I finished strong. My last mile was my fastest. Whatever is happening on race pace days, I&rsquo;d be one hundred percent happy with running the half marathon the way I&rsquo;m running these weekend long runs, if it means successfully running the whole way without bonking out or redlining mid-race.</p>
<p>Worth noting, I&rsquo;m generally trying to be conscious of how I feel <em>between</em> the runs, as one way of gauging how I&rsquo;m doing, and so far everything has felt, as best as I can tell, within reasonable bounds of expectation. I only felt a little rickety, this Saturday, is what I&rsquo;m saying. As a relatively old man doing his first half-marathon training I&rsquo;ll take &ldquo;a little rickety&rdquo; any day!</p>
<p>Monday&rsquo;s easy four miler? It rained. Hard. I was drenched within a minute of walking out the door. It was fine enough once I got going, and then it actually mostly stopped raining for the middle portion of the run. Then the rain returned with a vengeance for the final mile. it&rsquo;s been a week and I may actually still be soaked through from that run. I may never be dry again. Honestly the novelty of running in weather that probably made me look like an absolute crazy person was kind of worth it, it was certainly an interesting thing to do, but here&rsquo;s to hoping I don&rsquo;t have to make a habit out of it.</p>
<p>The other interesting thing about this week was that I&rsquo;d had to pull all these runs forward a day due to weekend scheduling conflicts. I can clearly say I did fine—I did it!—but also I felt sort of like could feel that missing extra full rest day, a bit. Not by much, and it felt good to know I could push through that, but there was maybe an extra notch of <em>ugh</em> on the old fatigue meter this week. I wasn&rsquo;t upset when I hit the weekend and had something resembling a full downtime day on Sunday.</p>
<p>I also haven&rsquo;t mentioned cross-training efforts here yet, I think, mostly because they&rsquo;re not interesting, but I&rsquo;m generally keeping up with them, which is nice; if nothing else, increasing my activity level across the week is a plus. It&rsquo;s typically been either an elliptical session or a bike ride, neither too strenous, just enough to loosen up. Mostly it&rsquo;s been the elliptical, as the weather has started turning. (As much as biking is my first love, it sure is easier to run in the cold than to bike.) I&rsquo;ve hit every middle-of-the-week session so far, with weekends being a bit spottier, based on general life happenings. So, like, this past Saturday I couldn&rsquo;t do anything formal, but after walking around Michigan parks for over 11,000 steps with my family, I think I can say: I&rsquo;m good!</p>
<p>Final bonus fun fact: I listened to the <a href="https://fujiyamiyagi.bandcamp.com/album/slight-variations">new Fujiya &amp; Miyagi album</a> for the first time during my long run. They&rsquo;re great. The album is great. Hearing David Best sing the line &ldquo;We&rsquo;re closer to the end than we are the beginning&rdquo; as I was literally crossing the four-mile midpoint of the run? Truly cosmic.</p>

			 <p>I’d flagged this week as the start of my build phase, but now I think it was maybe my last “gimme” week—there wasn&rsquo;t anything in the plan I haven&rsquo;t done before and it was mostly a question of doing it <em>now</em> as proof that I could be ready in time for what comes next. So I guess I&rsquo;ll call it a transition week?</p>
<p>My long run on Saturday was seven miles. I&rsquo;ve done seven before, a handful of times, and I felt comfortable taking it on this time, even keeping an average pace a notch faster than last week’s six miler. The weather didn&rsquo;t hurt—picture-perfect for running, overcast, low 60s, some breeze. In the past every time I&rsquo;ve hit this kind of distance I think I&rsquo;ve started to realize just how much the long run game is a mental one as it is a physical one. Running at a comfortable pace means feeling like I could, theoretically, physically do it forever; convincing myself, mentally, over and over again, that that is actually a good idea, a valid use of my time, <em>and</em> the actual goal is&hellip;weird. Realizing that Saturday&rsquo;s <em>last</em> mile was going to be my <em>middle</em> mile during the half marathon in eight weeks was also quite the rude perspective shift!</p>
<p>Thursday was the first &ldquo;race pace&rdquo; run. A mile warm up, a mile cool down, a race pace mile sandwiched in the middle. (Hold the mayo.) (Yes, I&rsquo;m a dad, have I mentioned that yet?) I&rsquo;d set a minute-long pace range that I wanted to maintain for that middle mile that was meant to feel like a stretch while also giving me plenty of leeway to make it feel right. Turns out what felt right was a pace fifteen seconds <em>faster</em> than my target range. It felt good! It felt good to open back up some for the first time since the 5k; it was nice to feel like I hadn&rsquo;t completely lost all the gains I made during that training period. Now, I really don&rsquo;t believe the pace I ran Thursday was something I could actually maintain for 13 (and an oh and a point and a one-zero) miles; I mean, maybe it is, maybe I&rsquo;m holding myself back, I know I&rsquo;m perpetually concerned about over-doing it. (As my wife has put it, &ldquo;Darby is very aware of his limits.&quot;) I don&rsquo;t know. Either way, I do like those fast-but-not-absurd runs, and I&rsquo;ve missed them since finishing the 5k training. Having that variety in the week is fun, a little spicy. I think I can safely slide my original target pace range forward by about 30 seconds. We&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>
<p>Tuesday night&rsquo;s easy run continued the trend out of the previous week of my easy pace naturally starting to lift; it felt more like the race pace I expected to do on Thursday night (which probably translated to me pushing that mile faster on Thursday). I think I was running off some stress, too. Either way: faster than expected. Not the third-in-a-row ultra-low-heart-rate-Tuesday-run in a row I was on the lookout for, which is fine.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, things definitely actually for-<em>real</em>-real get interesting the next three weeks. I add a mile a week to the long runs each week (three weeks of new longest runs ever!), and a half mile a week to the race pace segment on Thursdays; Tuesdays will lock in at four miles for a while. Plus I&rsquo;m pulling all my runs forward a day for the next two weeks, due to some weekend scheduling conflicts. Fingers crossed, that&rsquo;s not a recipe for disaster.</p>

			 <p>When I was setting up this training plan, I had mentally flagged this week not as a do-or-die week, but maybe as a sort of…do-or-seriously-reassess-my-life-choices week. All three runs were longer this week, taking me up to 14.5 miles; nothing too far outside my comfort zone yet, but it was going to be a big jump over last week’s 12.</p>
<p>The good news is, this week was…fairly uneventful! I feel like I’m relaxing into and enjoying the easy runs; my pace has been way below what I know I’m capable of, and I love it. After doing the speed thing earlier this year, running easy feels so pleasant. If I lost all interest in pushing my boundaries, I think I could happily repeat a week like this one for as long as my body wants to hold up.</p>
<p>The most newsworthy run was my 3.5 mile Tuesday run, which was my second shockingly low heart rate Tuesday run in a row. Either my watch glitched twice in a row, or I’m figuring out the zone two thing when I’m at my most well-rested. If I make it three in a row I’ll start to think I’m actually on to something. The Thursday five miler was smooth sailing; I’ve done pretty well in the heat this year, but yeah, the cooler night temperatures are making me happy. Despite shifting into the warmer afternoon today for six miles, I didn’t have any trouble getting through it, and even managed to clock my fastest pace for the week. Still slow! Still easy! But I’d be lying if I said it didn’t feel good to lop a few seconds off my pace without feeling like I was punishing myself in the process.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to week four, I’ll run less total mileage, but I’ll start introducing “race pace” runs on Thursdays. My plan for those miles right now (well, mile, this week—one race pace mile, between a warm up and cool down mile) is just to try to run a little faster than I have been lately; still trying to keep it completely doable, but a notch more intense. I’m giving myself a lot of latitude to experiment, to see what feels good and maintainable, while also knowing I’m not actually committing myself to running those paces on race day. I think it will be easier to figure out what I’m doing with those runs once I get a few behind me.</p>

			 <p>Not a bad week!</p>
<p>The three miler on Tuesday was weird. I knew I wanted to keep it light after the slugfest that was last Saturday, but…the maximum heart rate my watch reported at the end had to be an error. Was I even moving? Pace felt right, though, slow even for a generally slow runner like me, and I really didn’t feel even the slightest bit winded at the end of it, so…I don’t know. I’d like to try to do that again, whatever it is I did!</p>
<p>Thursday felt more typical. It also felt really good. Pace averaged out down under 11/min which is my current rough (and evolving) target for the half. It just felt like a really good run, like exactly the kind of run I hope to maintain for the half. Too soon to tell if that’s optimistic or not yet.</p>
<p>Saturday’s five miler I wound up running much earlier in the day than I usually do which mostly means it felt like I had to work for it a bit more than usual. But it was much smoother than last weekend’s four miler—never felt like I had to quit or stop, caught myself a couple times feeling like I was maybe starting to ramp up too much and started figuring out how to deliberately slow down a bit to compensate. (Also a good sign, I didn’t feel completely wiped out for the very long day of family activities I immediately transitioned to post-run.)</p>
<p>Overall this week felt like what I needed; both further cementing a healthy base and also recovering from the rough run last weekend. Which is the kind of thing that really only comes with the perspective of having been doing a thing for a while—once upon a time a crummy run meant I was a total failure and all my progress was lost and also I’m a huge fraud. Now it’s more just a bump in the road of a much longer game. Not that I don’t beat myself up for it, just…not as much.</p>
<p>The next two weeks I’ve felt for a while are going to be…interesting? Bellwethers? Things ramp up this week, all three runs are longer than the previous weeks’ counterparts, with a long 5 miler on Thursday and a 6 miler on Saturday. The following week mileage drops a bit for a bit but only because of the transition to race pace runs on Thursdays. It’s going to get interesting. And educational.</p>

			 <p>One week into the half marathon training plan. Still feel like I’m trying to get back into the swing of things, trying to relearn how to actually keep easy runs…easy.</p>
<p>The first two runs were pretty solid. I don’t think my knee is giving me any real trouble now.</p>
<p>Saturday’s four miler was one of my uglier runs, though; had to stop once or twice to get my heart rate back down because I could feel myself redlining. It was far warmer outside than I’d anticipated, which might have been part of the problem.</p>
<p>So that wasn’t ideal but the good takeaway was that—in the past when I’ve stopped like that I’ve typically struggled to keep going at all after; this time I did run all the miles. So that was an interesting development.</p>
<p>Also took a new set of shoes out for the first time, switching from my New Balance 860s to the Asics GT-2000s. I’ve been feeling like I’ve been landing hard in the 860s and felt like it was a good time to try something new after 3 years. One I got going I did like the feel of the Asics. We’ll see how they do over the next week.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had two nights with the PlayStation 5. Not coincidentally, I&rsquo;ve also recently had two utterly and completely blown bedtimes. And I have thoughts!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard about the adaptive triggers on the new controllers for a while now but I had no idea what any of it meant until I actually I booted up the <em>Astro&rsquo;s Playroom</em> demo game and actually <em>felt</em> them kick in. It&rsquo;s maybe weird to admit this, but it felt like a bit of a jaw-drop moment. I didn&rsquo;t really know that controllers themselves could still be developed in new and interesting ways. I don&rsquo;t know how <em>much</em> there is to be done with this, maybe it&rsquo;s just a weird gimmick, but it feels like a gimmick I would very much miss were it to stop being a thing.</p>
<p>I took the <em>Demon&rsquo;s Souls</em> remake for a brief spin, just through the intro tutorial and a tiny bit into wandering around the nexus. I played the heck out of the original back in the day and I&rsquo;m sure I have an incredibly nostalgic view of how good that game looked on the PS3. I imagine if I loaded it up today, it would still look <em>good</em>, I mean it would feel more like a modern game than anything on a PS1 would feel, but it couldn&rsquo;t look or feel as good as I remember it being. The PS5 remake, though&hellip;<em>it looks like my memory of the original</em>. It&rsquo;s somehow more real than my rose-tinted memory. It made me feel like I was having the kind of disorienting, out-of-time experience that could probably only be represented by an incredibly specific 23 syllable German word. I&rsquo;m looking forward to spending at least a little more time there.</p>
<p>From there I wanted to try something new and exclusive so I&rsquo;m taking <em>Returnal</em> for a spin. I&rsquo;ve been dipping back into <em>Dead Cells</em> again recently on my iPad so this sort of rogue-like system has been top of mind lately—it&rsquo;s kind of theoretically perfect for how I play games these days, anyways. Also, <em>Returnal</em> comes from Housemarque, which was responsible for <em>Resogun</em>, probably one of my top ten favorite games ever. So, I mean, it&rsquo;s an instant gotta-try game. I&rsquo;m telling myself I&rsquo;m not going to get locked into any one game out of the gate here, as I don&rsquo;t have much game-playing time at my disposal, and I want to sample broadly to see what&rsquo;s what out there, but darn it if after my first couple cycles through the game if I&rsquo;m not completely hooked on the story, the setting, the look, and the overall feel. It is so absurdly smooth; I&rsquo;m not prone to motion sickness in games, but oh, sometimes, jumping off a ledge, I can&rsquo;t help but kind of feel my inner ear start to tell me that <em>hey that ground sure is coming up at you real hard and fast right now</em>.</p>
<p>Still, between these two games there&rsquo;s definitely a sense of&hellip;like I said, the PS3 is closer to a PS5 than a PS1 is to a PS3; this feels like a more powerful iteration of something familiar, not a completely new thing entirely. But&hellip;what a compelling iteration it is. I love the Nintendo Switch and I love the games I&rsquo;m playing on that with my two boys; I mean, <em>Breath of the Wild</em> is so far beyond the hype its silly. I definitely have a few other gaming itches though that I think the PS5 is going to scratch.</p>
<p>One dumb complaint, though: the system interface feels crazy. Maybe they just nailed it with the PS4 interface, but I feel like I&rsquo;m still trying to wrap my head around what&rsquo;s available when and what these different hidden layers are and&hellip;yeah. I&rsquo;ll get used to it, I don&rsquo;t hate it, and maybe it&rsquo;ll get better if I learn what I can (and should) turn off, but right now it feels like just a bit too much.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://darby3.micro.blog/2022/08/29/190000.html">My (current, highly malleable) half-marathon plan 🏃</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://darby3.micro.blog/2022/08/29/190000.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-08-29 19:00:00 -0400">Aug 29, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about trying a half marathon—and, yes, a full marathon—for a while now. Now, I&rsquo;m actually planning on going after my first half marathon at the <a href="https://www.clewestrunningclub.org/fall-classic.html">Fall Classic</a> in Cleveland on November 22.</p>
<p>Why now? I&rsquo;ve been running for three years now, pretty consistently for the last year, and I still like it, I want to keep doing it, and I think I&rsquo;m in a good position to go for it. Coming off the 5k in July I know that having a challenge like that in front of me helps put the day-to-day activity into a framework that helps me keep my interest levels up. Also, I&rsquo;m 44, and while I know I&rsquo;ve got plenty of potential running years ahead of me should I choose to accept them, I also know I&rsquo;m not getting any younger, so if I&rsquo;ve got even a flicker of interest in it, now&rsquo;s probably the time to go for it.</p>
<p>I will also say that my goals here are all very soft. I know well that anything from cataclysmic injury to flagging interest in the face of the demanding commitment could derail the whole process and that&rsquo;s fine. If I make it, I want it to feel incredible, and if I don&rsquo;t, I want to remember that I&rsquo;m still running and have run more miles in this lifetime than I may ever have expected I would.</p>
<p>All that said, my ultimate goal, of course, is to tackle a full marathon. I&rsquo;ve been toying with some plans for a bit now and I think my best bet is start off with a half marathon in November, another in May 2023, and a third in November 2023, before moving on to the full marathon in May 2024. Assuming I&rsquo;m still healthy! And happy! And that there&rsquo;s still land to run on that hasn&rsquo;t been covered by the sea. I think this gives me the chance to build up my confidence and experiment with training approaches and intensities, while still pacing things out in a way so that it stays fun. I don&rsquo;t need to rush it and make myself miserable, but I don&rsquo;t want the big goal to be total vaporware.</p>
<p>For this first half marathon, my only goal right now is to run the whole thing without needing walking breaks. I don&rsquo;t want to set a firm time goal, though I&rsquo;m <em>guessing</em> I could land it somewhere between 2:15 and 2:30, if I can maintain a healthy pace for the duration. That said, I took walking breaks during my first 5k in 2019, and during my first 10k earlier this year, and even if I&rsquo;m running like a dream in the weeks leading up to the half marathon, I know there&rsquo;s a swell chance race-day nerves will kick in and I&rsquo;ll wind up coming out hot and I&rsquo;ll need to compensate later. Which will be perfectly fine—all the more reason for giving myself at least three attempts at the half distance before going on to full as I work on figuring out how to tame that tendency.</p>
<p>For my training schedule, I&rsquo;m going somewhat softly this first time, more softly in some ways than I did for the 5k in July. I&rsquo;m taking a hybrid of <a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/half-marathon-training-schedule-for-beginners-2911618">this beginner&rsquo;s plan</a> and <a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/advanced-beginner-half-marathon-training-schedule-2911617">this advanced beginer&rsquo;s plan</a>. I&rsquo;m taking the slightly more aggressive cadence of the advanced beginner&rsquo;s plan for the Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday runs, but I&rsquo;m swapping out the Sunday easy run in favor of cross-training, as suggested by the beginner&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going with the higher-mileage plan just because because I feel like I can do it, and that those few extra miles each week will help me feel more confident going into the race. Generally the miles will be easier miles than I did training for the 5k—like, no hard interval runs, this time out, and my &ldquo;race pace&rdquo; runs I <em>think</em> will be less intense than my threshhold runs from the 5k training plan. Mostly I want to continue educating my body about what my &ldquo;next gear&rdquo; feels like, to try to get some better sense of what sustainable and potential trouble each feel like. Honestly, pace in general is a huge question mark for me, right now, which is all the more reason to treat this first attempt as an educational experiment.</p>
<p>As for the extra cross-training day on Sundays, while I was running four days a week training for the 5k, while I&rsquo;m really excited to know I can do that, I kind of want to keep that in reserve for next time. If this first round goes well, introducing the fourth day again next time should be an easy way to help me improve from there. I do also wonder if it was maybe a shade too much, what with including hard intervals and fairly hard threshhold runs in the mix. I&rsquo;m still working my confidence back up after the mild knee injury I developed during the race and I&rsquo;m not looking to aggravate that just yet. So aside from just, you know, taking it easy on my joints, I&rsquo;ve also started getting out on my bicycles again, which has felt really nice, and I&rsquo;m happy to use cross-training as an excuse to keep putting some easy miles in on the wheels.</p>
<p>All that said, I can&rsquo;t lie—I&rsquo;m certainly already second-guessing myself, here. Was it a mistake to tell everyone so early that I&rsquo;m trying this? Is it a mistakle to try this at all? Is this actually already happening, is this real, am I really doing my first official training runs this week? I guess there&rsquo;s only one way to answer these questions.</p>

			 <p>First of all: I did the thing.</p>
<p><em>I did the thing!</em></p>
<p>That’s it. That’s the post-race thought.</p>
<p>As for my thoughts about the thought&hellip;</p>
<p>Before this, any time I&rsquo;ve raced, it&rsquo;s just been to finish, to cross the finish line. This was the first time I’ve trained and raced with a specific time goal. I&rsquo;m glad I went through this experiment, and not just because the training pushed me to crush my goal time. I feel like I learned a lot from it, about my range and capabilities as a runner; the effort made me stronger, the edges of my comfort zones pushed back a a couple notches, at least. And of course it kept me on track to keep running through the first hot part of summer.</p>
<p>Of course, ultimately crushing the goal time was like throwing a perfect cherry on top of the sundae&hellip;and then throwing an entire second sundae on top of that. All I <em>needed</em> to do to feel succesful was to beat my goal time by at least one second. To come in around three minutes under that time was right up there at the top end of my most optimistic, pie-in-the-sky, head-in-the-cloud secret goals.</p>
<p>My strategy for the run itself was to try to just <em>know</em> that I could do it, that I’d trained hard enough that I could just let my race day adrenaline do its thing. I pictured myself keeping things smooth but swift for the first two or so miles, so that I&rsquo;d be able to go all-out the last half-mile, but of course, my race day nerves had other plans, and I did almost the opposite of that, with a fast, hard first mile, and a second mile that wasn&rsquo;t too far off.</p>
<p>After that&hellip;I knew I was running fast and hard, but I didn&rsquo;t really know by how much. (I&rsquo;d made the conscious choice not to check my watch at all during the run, because I didn&rsquo;t want to psych myself out mid-race.) Rounding mile two I knew getting to the end was going to be as much a mental game as a physical one (oh, but it was still deeply, intensely physical!). Telling myself that whole last mile that I didn’t need to stop, that it wasn&rsquo;t time to stop yet, that I didn’t even <em>want</em> to stop, despite all the extremely hard and compelling evidence my body was throwing at me with each breath, was pretty much everything.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, that planned last half mile kick-up wasn&rsquo;t in the cards.. I knew I was already leaving everything out there I could, and the only thing left was to dig deep and keep going. Overall, my last mile was my slowest of the three, but the funny thing in retrospect is, is that it was still one of the three fastest complete miles I&rsquo;ve run maybe ever. &ldquo;Slowing down&rdquo; to what was still a ridiculously fast mile, for me? Priceless.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny to think about now, but at the time, it really felt like time and space were starting todo really weird things that final stretch. That last half mile straight-away up Belle Ave grew longer the further away from Lake Erie I ran. Someone kept moving the train tracks that crossed the mid-point kept moving away from me. The road was in fact rising to meet me&hellip;by becoming a mountain directly in front of my face.</p>
<p>And then somewhere past the tracks—actually, it&rsquo;s been days since the race and I&rsquo;m still not convinced I&rsquo;ve reached those tracks yet, but I digress—amid the noise of the street festival past the finish line and the folks cheering for the runners alongside the course—the cheers of strangers are, truly, gifts—there was a guy walking down the sidewalk reading numbers out loud off his phone, <em>twenty-six something</em>, <em>twenty-six something plus one</em>, <em>twenty-six something plus two</em>, and time really did actually slow down for a moment, and I slipped out of my body, and I processed this information, and I realized that I wasn’t just about to reach my goal—this big, dumb, stupid, pointless goal I’d set for myself two months earlier, that I&rsquo;d been quietly obsessing over for eight weeks—but that I was about to obliterate it, and that realization slammed be back down into my body, and I somehow ran <em>harder</em>.</p>
<p>I may never run like that again. But to feel the <em>something else</em> that lies just below the <em>nothing left</em> briefly take over? To feel that even once was a privilege and a delight. And then going from that to crossing the finish line, running straight into my family—my poor family, having my sweat-drenched, hyperventilating form collapsing all over them—was just perfect.</p>

			 <p>I was chatting with a friend of mine about running, and she suggested she might come back to me for training plan advice, which is hilarious because nobody should ask me for advice about anything, ever. That said, that conversation prompted me to think I should probably brain-dump what I&rsquo;ve learned over the last eight weeks, while it&rsquo;s top of mind, even if only for my own reference later.</p>
<p>Long story short: I ran my first official 10k in May, at which point I realized I had exactly 8 weeks to go before my next race, a 5k. I&rsquo;ve been running for about 3 years at this point, though I didn&rsquo;t get really consistent with it until about last September, after completely bottoming out last summer. Coming out of this stretch of consistency, I was concerned about the summer—I did so well during the winter, would I lose all my progress when the summer heat hit? Having a formal short-term goal on top of a real training plan felt like a good way to keep my motivation and momentum up.</p>
<p>So, I set the goal of not just making it to the 5k, but PRing at it&hellip;even if only by one second. Up to this point I&rsquo;ve mostly tried to look at speed and pace as interesting but not important. I&rsquo;m too old to need to go fast. My goals this year have been more around consistency and racking up a certain number of miles over the course of the year. But, given how I&rsquo;ve felt lately and the level consistency I&rsquo;ve maintained, speed has felt like something interesting I could play with. I&rsquo;ve felt like I <em>could</em> consciously boost my pace a bit, even if only for one race. So I decided to go for it, knowing once the race is behind me I can happily revert to easier runs to ride out the rest of the summer.</p>
<p>Training plans for running are a dime a dozen. After searching for one intended to help improve a 5k race time, <a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/5k-intermediate-run-training-2911620">I found this one at Verywell Fit</a>, which felt <em>right</em>, for me, like something I could apply to my current situation with some ease.</p>
<p>I say <em>apply</em> because I had no intention of following any plan to the letter, instead choosing to freely adjust it to meet my needs. I dropped the plan back to 4 runs a week rather than 5; up to that point I was still generally running only 3 times a week, and jumping to 5 felt like a bad idea. I&rsquo;ve been interested in trying to get an extra run in during the week, though, so it felt like 4 runs a week was a comfortable stretch I was ready to try to make.</p>
<p>I kept what I thought of as the three core runs—the interval run (or, &ldquo;the one with lots of extremely short, stupidly fast runs&rdquo;), the tempo run (or, &ldquo;the one with the mid-length, maintainably swift run&rdquo;), and the long, slow run (or, &ldquo;the one with the I-feel-like-I-could-literally-do-this-forever run&rdquo;)—because I wanted to formally experiment with speed while also consciously slowing down my long run.</p>
<p>A little back story on that last point: leading up to the 10k in May I realized that I was kind of just going out and doing the same run all the time, generally going fast-for-me every time, and while I was getting faster, it also felt unsustainable. I wasn&rsquo;t playing with all the keys on the piano. Reading around online I kept seeing the same refrain about how most of your training run time should really be lighter, slower, more at a conversational pace. So even before I started the plan I was trying to learn how to slow down more often; with the plan, dedicating a couple runs each week to speed also meant trying my hardest to keep my other runs more low-key, either by pace or heart rate.</p>
<p>All told, all of this pushed me to broaden my sense of my range as a runner—which, yes, calling myself a &ldquo;runner&rdquo; makes me feel like a huge imposter, still, sure—to really see what I was capable of at the upper and lower ends of my dials, and to start playing around a bit more with my sense of control and feel. Should I choose to focus on speed, like I plan to do at this race, I have a better sense of what healthy speed feels like and how very bad uh-oh-bad-idea speed can feel, the difference between the pace that can get me through the first two-thirds of the race and the pace I can throw at the last half mile because there&rsquo;s no reason to hold anything back because I will never ever ever have to run ever again for as long as I live as soon as I hit that finish line (at least until I go out again for my next run sometime after the race). Whatever happens at the race, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve bettered my sense of feel.</p>
<p>As I said above I did introduce a fourth easy run to my week. With interval runs on Tuesday, tempo runs on Thursday, and my long run on Saturday, I put the easy run on Monday, thinking to give myself a rest day after my long run day (and a free night to enjoy an adult beverage or two on Saturdays, after that long run!). This worked for me, there was a nice rhythm to the week, and I&rsquo;m hoping after the race to keep the fourth run going, after a couple super easy recovery weeks. I might move it back to Sundays, to the weekend, because holy moly do the weeks feel <em>full</em> right now, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>I liked the rhythm of having at most two runs two days in a row, for me, where I&rsquo;m at now. There was one week where I did have to move my Monday easy run to Wednesday, and while I did it, while I made three days in a row work that one time, and I actually did pretty well on that Thursday tempo run, I think I still prefer the more steady rate of rest days between run days. It definitely caught up to me in the fays that followed. I&rsquo;m not there yet, at least not with those fairly intense runs in the mix.</p>
<p>I did little cross-training, because time is hard, though I did try to make sure I walked at least one good solid mile every day to help keep things loose, either as a lunchtime break or just around parks trying to keep up with my two kids. It&rsquo;s not much, but it&rsquo;s something. Again, unless the Olympics open up to middle-aged guys who drink beer for fun, what I&rsquo;m doing right now is just fine, thanks.</p>
<p>I also found a yoga routine that I liked, which occupied Wednesday nights. I&rsquo;m pretty hooked on that now. The one time I skipped that was the one week where I had some pain that tipped from &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an old man and I&rsquo;m naturally creaky and of course I hurt but it&rsquo;s, like, a <em>good</em> hurt&rdquo; over to &ldquo;Oh no, my body is 75 percent broken-down rusty old cars and 25 percent small woodland creatures making their homes inside those cars.&rdquo; That week I had to skip my tempo run and shorten my long run; that little bit of recovery space cleared the way for a strong finish, though, letting me land my first (and last, for a while!) 20+ mile week ever just last week.</p>
<p>All in all, the training plan itself went pretty well. I liked making the plan and then following it—doing 90 percent of the thinking up front, mostly, and then just doing the doing after that. For the most part, at least. I definitely felt free to modify details as I went based on what I learned along the way. I learned a bit about when I&rsquo;m better doing a run by pace instead of heart rate; how to set my watch to give me useful information instead of just constantly screaming at me the whole time that I, a total hobbyist, was unable to consistently keep a completely consistent tempo within a narrow 20 second range; when to go a little harder and when to ease up.</p>
<p>On the flip side&hellip;putting all this time toward one specific goal that&rsquo;s going to happen in a single half-hour timespan early on a single Saturday evening is a weird headspace to be in. That&rsquo;s the mental game, though. I tell myself that what actually happens at the race doesn&rsquo;t matter—I could absolutely flub it and have the worst run of my life, and it wouldn&rsquo;t matter one bit, because the process of getting to that point, the work and improvements I&rsquo;ve enjoyed leading up to the race, that&rsquo;s the part that really matters for me.</p>
<p>Which is a very nice thing to tell myself! And it might even be true! Still, though, obviously, of course I&rsquo;d be lying if I said that reaching that goal, perhaps even crushing it, reaching one of the <em>secret goals</em> I have locked away inside my brain for fear of ruining them by even thinking of speaking them aloud, doesn&rsquo;t actually matter to me at all. It does. Doing the thing would obviously be the incredibly delightful cherry to drop on top of this sundae. The sundae doesn&rsquo;t really need it, but it sure would look nice, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a couple easy runs ahead of me this week, a couple extra rest days, and then it&rsquo;s race day. My hope is that I&rsquo;ve both learned a few things that will help me run a better race than I have in the past, and that I&rsquo;ve also conditioned my system enough so that I comfortably take all my extra race-day adrenaline and pour it all out onto the race course. Whatever happens, it&rsquo;s not going to matter, but also, I feel pretty good about what could happen.</p>
<p>Once I actually get to do the thing. Can I just do it right now? Get it over with? That&rsquo;d be nice. No? No? Darn. Worth the ask, anyway.</p>

			 <p>I started running in 2019 in order to do the <a href="https://runsignup.com/Race/OH/Cleveland/StrollRoll5K1MileFunRun">MetroHealth Friends of Mothers &amp; Infants Stroll &amp; Roll 5K</a>. The race supports a great cause, and in just a few months, it forced me to go from “Running a full mile would be kind of a neat thing to do!” to “Wow, I just ran three miles! Nobody in the history of the world has ever done that before! I am <em>amazing</em>!”</p>
<p>And then I kept running.</p>
<p>Kind of.</p>
<p>Looking back, I realize my consistency those first two years was very hit or miss. I&rsquo;m not surprised that it culminated in a full-scale break-down blow-out &ldquo;This is stupid! I quit! And&hellip;and…did I mention this is stupid?&rdquo; moment last summer. There were other factors at play, sure, but also, it was stupid and running was stupid and I quit.</p>
<p>Turns out, sometimes quitting is smart. I needed to walk away from my running-induced frustrations for a while. After clearing my head, I realized running wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> stupid. And that I wasn&rsquo;t ready to quit.</p>
<p>So I started back up September with a nice easy 1 mile run.</p>
<p>And <em>then</em> I kept running.</p>
<p>Not every specific run has been fun, obviously, but running itself has been fun in general. I&rsquo;m not setting world records, I&rsquo;m not looking to compete against others. But my confidence and enjoyment have both increased.</p>
<p>Races have helped. I did the Stroll &amp; Roll again in the fall, and then I ran a chilly 5k at the <a href="https://www.clewestrunningclub.org/fall-classic.html">Cleveland Fall Classic</a>, and then in the spring I achieved the personal bucket list item of doing a 5k in under 30 minutes at the <a href="https://runsignup.com/Race/OH/Cleveland/TreatYoSelf">Treat Yo Self 5k</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out, consistency is good. Who knew! Doing the thing means you can do the thing! And I’m pretty sure I have gotten better at doing the thing, too. Now, I think, from a certain angle, if you squint at the last nine months <em>just</em> right, I think you can safely say that I’ve gone from “very slow but well-meaning” to “kind of actually approaching something resembling thoroughly average”.</p>
<p>Progress!</p>
<p>Most recently I ran the 10k the weekend of the <a href="https://www.clevelandmarathon.com/">Cleveland Marathon</a>, where I didn&rsquo;t do as well as I&rsquo;d hoped I would, and am totally and completely fine with that. What mattered to me more was just doing it at all, getting the experience of it, the education from it, and also oh yeah surprising myself with some really great runs leading up to the race.</p>
<p>And, just, I mean&hellip;I did the thing! It&rsquo;s possible I wore my finisher medal around the house for about a week afterward! Ask my family how much fun and totally not insufferable I am!</p>
<p>Next up, I&rsquo;m running the <a href="https://runsignup.com/Race/OH/Lakewood/SummerMeltdown5K">Lakewood Summer Meltdown 5k</a>. This race happens in shouting distance of my house and I&rsquo;ve wanted to do it since I started running. Since even before that: being a bystander at the party in the preceding years, seeing people crossing the finish line, feeling the energy in the air around it all, I think that contributed a lot to me even <em>thinking</em> about starting running.</p>
<p>After I finished the 10k in May I realized I had exactly 8 weeks until the Meltdown 5k. It felt like a good time to experiment with my running schedule and explore different kinds of runs, with the goal of getting my speed up, even just a quarter-notch or so, in order to try to set a new 5k PR at the race. Lo and behold, I found <a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/5k-intermediate-run-training-2911620">a training plan that catered exactly to that</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about halfway through this 8 week session. I think it&rsquo;s been going well! I stepped that plan back slightly at the outset—before this I was only running 3 days a week; and 5 felt like it would have been too much of a jump, especially for an old man like me, but 4 felt like a nice, attainable stretch goal, a limit I could get behind pushing. So I&rsquo;m following the interval run, tempo run, and long run routine, with an extra easy run mixed in there.</p>
<p>This has smoothly but also dramatically pushed my weekly mileage up each week from where I was around the time of the 10k. It&rsquo;s also varied the kinds of miles I&rsquo;m running, which has been educational. Consciously doing &ldquo;easier&rdquo; miles has felt weird, even for someone who doesn&rsquo;t really go all that fast when he&rsquo;s going his fastest, but getting a broader sense of my range, a greater feel for what I can do (run 0.25 mile sprint at a sub-7:30 pace!) and can’t do (run a 0.25 mile sprint at a sub-7:30 pace if I’m going to do more than a few of those sprints in a single session!) has been interesting. It&rsquo;s fun to know what my hardest-run interval feels like, compared to those easy-breezy I-could-do-this-forever slow-boat long-run miles. Also turns out I absolutely love whatever passes for my version of a tempo run. Cool! That probably means I’m doing it wrong! Bummer!</p>
<p>As for my race goal, if I can shave just one second off my last 5k race time, this will be a total and complete personal victory. And if I don’t, I don’t. But I think I can. So I’m going to go for it.</p>
<p>After that, I’m pondering where I’m going to go from here. There’s a lot of options, now, which is kind of a wild place to be.</p>
