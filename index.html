		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I was chatting with a friend of mine about running, and she suggested she might come back to me for training plan advice, which is hilarious because nobody should ask me for advice about anything, ever. That said, that conversation prompted me to think I should probably brain-dump what I&rsquo;ve learned over the last eight weeks, while it&rsquo;s top of mind, even if only for my own reference later.</p>
<p>Long story short: I ran my first official 10k in May, at which point I realized I had exactly 8 weeks to go before my next race, a 5k. I&rsquo;ve been running for about 3 years at this point, though I didn&rsquo;t get really consistent with it until about last September, after completely bottoming out last summer. Coming out of this stretch of consistency, I was concerned about the summer‚ÄîI did so well during the winter, would I lose all my progress when the summer heat hit? Having a formal short-term goal on top of a real training plan felt like a good way to keep my motivation and momentum up.</p>
<p>So, I set the goal of not just making it to the 5k, but PRing at it&hellip;even if only by one second. Up to this point I&rsquo;ve mostly tried to look at speed and pace as interesting but not important. I&rsquo;m too old to need to go fast. My goals this year have been more around consistency and racking up a certain number of miles over the course of the year. But, given how I&rsquo;ve felt lately and the level consistency I&rsquo;ve maintained, speed has felt like something interesting I could play with. I&rsquo;ve felt like I <em>could</em> consciously boost my pace a bit, even if only for one race. So I decided to go for it, knowing once the race is behind me I can happily revert to easier runs to ride out the rest of the summer.</p>
<p>Training plans for running are a dime a dozen. After searching for one intended to help improve a 5k race time, <a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/5k-intermediate-run-training-2911620">I found this one at Verywell Fit</a>, which felt <em>right</em>, for me, like something I could apply to my current situation with some ease.</p>
<p>I say <em>apply</em> because I had no intention of following any plan to the letter, instead choosing to freely adjust it to meet my needs. I dropped the plan back to 4 runs a week rather than 5; up to that point I was still generally running only 3 times a week, and jumping to 5 felt like a bad idea. I&rsquo;ve been interested in trying to get an extra run in during the week, though, so it felt like 4 runs a week was a comfortable stretch I was ready to try to make.</p>
<p>I kept what I thought of as the three core runs‚Äîthe interval run (or, &ldquo;the one with lots of extremely short, stupidly fast runs&rdquo;), the tempo run (or, &ldquo;the one with the mid-length, maintainably swift run&rdquo;), and the long, slow run (or, &ldquo;the one with the I-feel-like-I-could-literally-do-this-forever run&rdquo;)‚Äîbecause I wanted to formally experiment with speed while also consciously slowing down my long run.</p>
<p>A little back story on that last point: leading up to the 10k in May I realized that I was kind of just going out and doing the same run all the time, generally going fast-for-me every time, and while I was getting faster, it also felt unsustainable. I wasn&rsquo;t playing with all the keys on the piano. Reading around online I kept seeing the same refrain about how most of your training run time should really be lighter, slower, more at a conversational pace. So even before I started the plan I was trying to learn how to slow down more often; with the plan, dedicating a couple runs each week to speed also meant trying my hardest to keep my other runs more low-key, either by pace or heart rate.</p>
<p>All told, all of this pushed me to broaden my sense of my range as a runner‚Äîwhich, yes, calling myself a &ldquo;runner&rdquo; makes me feel like a huge imposter, still, sure‚Äîto really see what I was capable of at the upper and lower ends of my dials, and to start playing around a bit more with my sense of control and feel. Should I choose to focus on speed, like I plan to do at this race, I have a better sense of what healthy speed feels like and how very bad uh-oh-bad-idea speed can feel, the difference between the pace that can get me through the first two-thirds of the race and the pace I can throw at the last half mile because there&rsquo;s no reason to hold anything back because I will never ever ever have to run ever again for as long as I live as soon as I hit that finish line (at least until I go out again for my next run sometime after the race). Whatever happens at the race, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve bettered my sense of feel.</p>
<p>As I said above I did introduce a fourth easy run to my week. With interval runs on Tuesday, tempo runs on Thursday, and my long run on Saturday, I put the easy run on Monday, thinking to give myself a rest day after my long run day (and a free night to enjoy an adult beverage or two on Saturdays, after that long run!). This worked for me, there was a nice rhythm to the week, and I&rsquo;m hoping after the race to keep the fourth run going, after a couple super easy recovery weeks. I might move it back to Sundays, to the weekend, because holy moly do the weeks feel <em>full</em> right now, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>I liked the rhythm of having at most two runs two days in a row, for me, where I&rsquo;m at now. There was one week where I did have to move my Monday easy run to Wednesday, and while I did it, while I made three days in a row work that one time, and I actually did pretty well on that Thursday tempo run, I think I still prefer the more steady rate of rest days between run days. It definitely caught up to me in the fays that followed. I&rsquo;m not there yet, at least not with those fairly intense runs in the mix.</p>
<p>I did little cross-training, because time is hard, though I did try to make sure I walked at least one good solid mile every day to help keep things loose, either as a lunchtime break or just around parks trying to keep up with my two kids. It&rsquo;s not much, but it&rsquo;s something. Again, unless the Olympics open up to middle-aged guys who drink beer for fun, what I&rsquo;m doing right now is just fine, thanks.</p>
<p>I also found a yoga routine that I liked, which occupied Wednesday nights. I&rsquo;m pretty hooked on that now. The one time I skipped that was the one week where I had some pain that tipped from &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an old man and I&rsquo;m naturally creaky and of course I hurt but it&rsquo;s, like, a <em>good</em> hurt&rdquo; over to &ldquo;Oh no, my body is 75 percent broken-down rusty old cars and 25 percent small woodland creatures making their homes inside those cars.&rdquo; That week I had to skip my tempo run and shorten my long run; that little bit of recovery space cleared the way for a strong finish, though, letting me land my first (and last, for a while!) 20+ mile week ever just last week.</p>
<p>All in all, the training plan itself went pretty well. I liked making the plan and then following it‚Äîdoing 90 percent of the thinking up front, mostly, and then just doing the doing after that. For the most part, at least. I definitely felt free to modify details as I went based on what I learned along the way. I learned a bit about when I&rsquo;m better doing a run by pace instead of heart rate; how to set my watch to give me useful information instead of just constantly screaming at me the whole time that I, a total hobbyist, was unable to consistently keep a completely consistent tempo within a narrow 20 second range; when to go a little harder and when to ease up.</p>
<p>On the flip side&hellip;putting all this time toward one specific goal that&rsquo;s going to happen in a single half-hour timespan early on a single Saturday evening is a weird headspace to be in. That&rsquo;s the mental game, though. I tell myself that what actually happens at the race doesn&rsquo;t matter‚ÄîI could absolutely flub it and have the worst run of my life, and it wouldn&rsquo;t matter one bit, because the process of getting to that point, the work and improvements I&rsquo;ve enjoyed leading up to the race, that&rsquo;s the part that really matters for me.</p>
<p>Which is a very nice thing to tell myself! And it might even be true! Still, though, obviously, of course I&rsquo;d be lying if I said that reaching that goal, perhaps even crushing it, reaching one of the <em>secret goals</em> I have locked away inside my brain for fear of ruining them by even thinking of speaking them aloud, doesn&rsquo;t actually matter to me at all. It does. Doing the thing would obviously be the incredibly delightful cherry to drop on top of this sundae. The sundae doesn&rsquo;t really need it, but it sure would look nice, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a couple easy runs ahead of me this week, a couple extra rest days, and then it&rsquo;s race day. My hope is that I&rsquo;ve both learned a few things that will help me run a better race than I have in the past, and that I&rsquo;ve also conditioned my system enough so that I comfortably take all my extra race-day adrenaline and pour it all out onto the race course. Whatever happens, it&rsquo;s not going to matter, but also, I feel pretty good about what could happen.</p>
<p>Once I actually get to do the thing. Can I just do it right now? Get it over with? That&rsquo;d be nice. No? No? Darn. Worth the ask, anyway.</p>

			 <p>I started running in 2019 in order to do the <a href="https://runsignup.com/Race/OH/Cleveland/StrollRoll5K1MileFunRun">MetroHealth Friends of Mothers &amp; Infants Stroll &amp; Roll 5K</a>. The race supports a great cause, and in just a few months, it forced me to go from ‚ÄúRunning a full mile would be kind of a neat thing to do!‚Äù to ‚ÄúWow, I just ran three miles! Nobody in the history of the world has ever done that before! I am <em>amazing</em>!‚Äù</p>
<p>And then I kept running.</p>
<p>Kind of.</p>
<p>Looking back, I realize my consistency those first two years was very hit or miss. I&rsquo;m not surprised that it culminated in a full-scale break-down blow-out &ldquo;This is stupid! I quit! And&hellip;and‚Ä¶did I mention this is stupid?&rdquo; moment last summer. There were other factors at play, sure, but also, it was stupid and running was stupid and I quit.</p>
<p>Turns out, sometimes quitting is smart. I needed to walk away from my running-induced frustrations for a while. After clearing my head, I realized running wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> stupid. And that I wasn&rsquo;t ready to quit.</p>
<p>So I started back up September with a nice easy 1 mile run.</p>
<p>And <em>then</em> I kept running.</p>
<p>Not every specific run has been fun, obviously, but running itself has been fun in general. I&rsquo;m not setting world records, I&rsquo;m not looking to compete against others. But my confidence and enjoyment have both increased.</p>
<p>Races have helped. I did the Stroll &amp; Roll again in the fall, and then I ran a chilly 5k at the <a href="https://www.clewestrunningclub.org/fall-classic.html">Cleveland Fall Classic</a>, and then in the spring I achieved the personal bucket list item of doing a 5k in under 30 minutes at the <a href="https://runsignup.com/Race/OH/Cleveland/TreatYoSelf">Treat Yo Self 5k</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out, consistency is good. Who knew! Doing the thing means you can do the thing! And I‚Äôm pretty sure I have gotten better at doing the thing, too. Now, I think, from a certain angle, if you squint at the last nine months <em>just</em> right, I think you can safely say that I‚Äôve gone from ‚Äúvery slow but well-meaning‚Äù to ‚Äúkind of actually approaching something resembling thoroughly average‚Äù.</p>
<p>Progress!</p>
<p>Most recently I ran the 10k the weekend of the <a href="https://www.clevelandmarathon.com/">Cleveland Marathon</a>, where I didn&rsquo;t do as well as I&rsquo;d hoped I would, and am totally and completely fine with that. What mattered to me more was just doing it at all, getting the experience of it, the education from it, and also oh yeah surprising myself with some really great runs leading up to the race.</p>
<p>And, just, I mean&hellip;I did the thing! It&rsquo;s possible I wore my finisher medal around the house for about a week afterward! Ask my family how much fun and totally not insufferable I am!</p>
<p>Next up, I&rsquo;m running the <a href="https://runsignup.com/Race/OH/Lakewood/SummerMeltdown5K">Lakewood Summer Meltdown 5k</a>. This race happens in shouting distance of my house and I&rsquo;ve wanted to do it since I started running. Since even before that: being a bystander at the party in the preceding years, seeing people crossing the finish line, feeling the energy in the air around it all, I think that contributed a lot to me even <em>thinking</em> about starting running.</p>
<p>After I finished the 10k in May I realized I had exactly 8 weeks until the Meltdown 5k. It felt like a good time to experiment with my running schedule and explore different kinds of runs, with the goal of getting my speed up, even just a quarter-notch or so, in order to try to set a new 5k PR at the race. Lo and behold, I found <a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/5k-intermediate-run-training-2911620">a training plan that catered exactly to that</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m about halfway through this 8 week session. I think it&rsquo;s been going well! I stepped that plan back slightly at the outset‚Äîbefore this I was only running 3 days a week; and 5 felt like it would have been too much of a jump, especially for an old man like me, but 4 felt like a nice, attainable stretch goal, a limit I could get behind pushing. So I&rsquo;m following the interval run, tempo run, and long run routine, with an extra easy run mixed in there.</p>
<p>This has smoothly but also dramatically pushed my weekly mileage up each week from where I was around the time of the 10k. It&rsquo;s also varied the kinds of miles I&rsquo;m running, which has been educational. Consciously doing &ldquo;easier&rdquo; miles has felt weird, even for someone who doesn&rsquo;t really go all that fast when he&rsquo;s going his fastest, but getting a broader sense of my range, a greater feel for what I can do (run 0.25 mile sprint at a sub-7:30 pace!) and can‚Äôt do (run a 0.25 mile sprint at a sub-7:30 pace if I‚Äôm going to do more than a few of those sprints in a single session!) has been interesting. It&rsquo;s fun to know what my hardest-run interval feels like, compared to those easy-breezy I-could-do-this-forever slow-boat long-run miles. Also turns out I absolutely love whatever passes for my version of a tempo run. Cool! That probably means I‚Äôm doing it wrong! Bummer!</p>
<p>As for my race goal, if I can shave just one second off my last 5k race time, this will be a total and complete personal victory. And if I don‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt. But I think I can. So I‚Äôm going to go for it.</p>
<p>After that, I‚Äôm pondering where I‚Äôm going to go from here. There‚Äôs a lot of options, now, which is kind of a wild place to be.</p>
